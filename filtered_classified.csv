It refers to an organized structure representing resources in the form of opc UA nodes residing in an opc UA address space. Before runtime, an opc UA server requires an opc UA information model already filled with opc UA nodes corresponding to the available resources of its field devices. It is tricky to the Industrial Internet of Things, a scenario where random field devices can join a sys-tem at any time. Indeed, the opc UA server needs to dynamically discover such devices and update its opc UA information model with new relevant opc UA nodes. Regarding the above challenge, this paper introduces a Web-of-Things (WoT) approach that enables field devices to register with an opc UA server to join the system without manual configuration. The approach relies on WoT Discovery and WoT Thing Description",Industry;Internet of Things;OPC UA;Web of Things;Thing Description;Discovery,Runtime;Conferences;Semantics;Manuals;Production facilities;Registers;Servers,IEEE Conferences

The OPC UA supports clients/server (C/S) and publisher/subscriber (Pub/Sub) communication modes, using the Pub/Sub mode with the Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) technology can greatly improve the real-time capability of the OPC UA. In factory field automation communication systems, various OPC UA servers are embedded in controllers, sensors, and actuators to enable the reliable exchange of information among each system with different data streams (i.e., real-time and non-real-time). It is hard to configure and manage such a large number of heterogeneous OPC UA servers. In this work, we propose an OPC UA multi-server aggregation and management architecture for industrial field networks, which supports the automatic discovery and aggregate of OPC UA servers, and a centralized configuration management method for OPC UA communication data streams is also supported. A laboratory-level OPC UA multi-server aggregation management platform is implemented to validate the proposed architecture. The test results demonstrate that the platform can support centralized management and configuration of multiple OPC UA servers and their corresponding data streams through a uniform OPC UA interface.",automated industry;OPC UA;TSN;server aggregation,Social computing;Data security;Configuration management;Production facilities;Real-time systems;Data models;Service-oriented architecture,IEEE Conferences

Once other devices and systems understand the schema, they can interact appropriately with the industrial system. Thus, designing the OPC UA information model is an undeniable and essential practice of OPC UA-based industrial system engineering. However, both academia and industry suffer from a lack of shared experiences on this subject. This gap motivated us to share our experiences on the development of an OPC UA information model.

Built-in security mechanisms enable these protocols to protect communication and defend against network attacks. However, before IIoT devices can utilize these security mechanisms, they need to be securely onboarded in the network. Although several onboarding solutions exist, there is no widely applicable and easy solution for all protocols. Thus, owners of IIoT devices must currently perform multiple processes until they can securely use a device in operation, which requires a high amount of manual effort and onboarding infrastructure.In this work, we present a generic secure onboarding solution for a broad range of network protocols based on OPC UA. OPC UA is particularly suited for this task, as it is one of the most widespread IIoT protocols and one of few protocols whose standard defines a secure onboarding. Our solution leverages the OPC UA onboarding process to equip other IIoT protocols with the initial trust and credentials to establish secure connections. To this end, only minor extensions to the OPC UA implementation on devices are necessary, such that device owners can reuse their OPC UA onboarding infrastructure without any modifications. As a proof of concept for our solution, we demonstrate the secure onboarding of an HTTPS web server. Our implementation fully reuses the reference implementation OPC UA sample server as infrastructure and only needs minor extensions to the IIoT device.",OPC UA;secure onboarding;Industry 4.0,Performance evaluation;Protocols;Authentication;Web servers;Security;Task analysis;Standards,IEEE Conferences

We have developed a dedicated hardware engine that offloads processing of the OPC UA protocol and enables the realization of compact and low-power field devices with OPC UA support. As part of a proof-of-concept embedded system, we have implemented this engine in a 22-nm FDSOI technology, representing the first ASIC implementation of an OPC UA server. We measured performance, power consumption, and memory footprint of our test chip and compared it with a software implementation based on open62541 and a Raspberry Pi 2B. Our OPC UA hardware engine is 50 times more energy efficient and only requires 36 KiB of memory. The complete system consumes only 24 mW under full load, making it suitable for low-power embedded applications.",FDSOI;field devices;industrial automation;Internet of Things;open platform communications unified architecture (OPC UA),Engines;Software;Random access memory;Hardware;Servers;Semiconductor device measurement;Semantics,IEEE Journals

OPC UA wrapper is a migration strategy that provides UA clients with seamless access to legacy servers having OPC classic interfaces. This paper presents the design of a standalone OPC UA wrapper and discusses its performance through extensive experiments using a prototype implementation. The wrapper consists of two main components, i.e., UA server and classic client, which communicate with each other via shared memory and semaphore. One important feature of the design is that it employs a distributed component object model runtime library implemented in Java for platform independence. This makes it possible to build a cost-competitive wrapper system by using commercial off-the-shelf non-Windows solutions with low-cost microprocessors. Another key feature is the event-driven update interface between the UA and classic components, which we propose as an alternative to the sampling-based mechanism for the reduced delay. Through experiments using workloads from an industrial monitoring system, we present a systematic approach of identifying the system parameters having a direct impact on the wrapper performance and eventually tuning them such that the read and subscription services of OPC UA exhibit the best performance.",OPC unified architecture;OPC UA wrapper;monitoring and control systems;read and subscription service,Servers;Monitoring;Standards;Control systems;Delays;Automation;Prototypes,IEEE Journals

Beginning from OPC UA v1.04, which was released in 2021, Pub/Sub mode has been supported in addition to Client/Server. Because it can easily support much more communications than usual, it can support all use cases in the industrial sector. An important property of OPC UA is encryption.

There are many types of machines, such as operating support systems and engineering workstations, that can send commands to controllers.

Industrial IoT technologies are applied to different industrial scenarios. OPC UA is a service-oriented architecture, which has good interoperability. At the same time, it is a cross-platform communication standard that can realize the interconnection between heterogeneous network devices and solve the problem of information silos in the industrial IoT field. However, with the gradual increase of industrial equipment, the amount of data transmission in the network is increasing. The traditional OPC UA communication method based on client/server mode has defects such as tight coupling and performance bottleneck. It cannot meet the high throughput demand of the network. Therefore, these phenomena lead to longer time delays and lower transmission efficiency of network communication systems. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a publish/subscribe communication model based on OPC UA. We design the overall architecture of the OPC UA publish/subscribe model and adopt a message agent mechanism to realize distributed communication of OPC UA. This model has functions such as message modeling, address space construction, and publish/subscribe. The architecture of this communication model is compatible with the C/S model, which can ensure compatibility and coexistence with the traditional OPC UA communication system. Meanwhile, in order to improve the distinguished service capability of the OPC UA system, a multi-priority data scheduling algorithm is proposed and integrated into the publish/subscribe communication model to improve the efficiency of real-time data transmission in industrial networks. The experimental results show that the communication model can accomplish distributed communication in industrial networks and be better applied in wireless sensor networks. The scheduling algorithm included in the model significantly improves the efficiency of real-time data transmission and reduces the time delay.",OPC UA;publish/subscribe;distributed communications;scheduling algorithms;industrial IoT,Wireless sensor networks;Scheduling algorithms;Delay effects;Distributed databases;Throughput;Data models;Real-time systems,IEEE Conferences

Traditional ways of constructing OPC UA information model need to manually add and define different nodes describing the devices and their attributes (e.g., names, ID, data types, etc.), which is costly and time-consuming when a huge number of devices is involved. Some works defined mapping rules between existing data model/structure/exchange format and OPC UA information model to reduce the workloads. However, they ignored the construction process of OPC UA information model and assumed that the existing referenced data structure/exchange format was created before the transformation of information model. Also, the mapping rules do not provide detailed implementation of mapping method. In this paper, we take the first attempt on the fast construction process of OPC UA information model.

The server is able to aggregate information models based on the current meta model mapping of the AAS, regardless of whether the base servers implement this or not. Moreover the aggregated server can route OPC UA services down to the base servers and is managing itself in case of discovery and information aggregation. This approach can be used as the standalone interface for data integration in respective data platforms.",Industrie 4.0;Digital Twin;Asset Administration Shell;OPC UA;Data Aggregation;Big Data Platform;Data Integration,Industries;Conferences;Aggregates;Data integration;Servers;Task analysis;Manufacturing automation,IEEE Conferences

Protocols for machine-to-machine communication, like OPC UA, can provide this security. However, before using their security mechanisms, a trust relationship between the application and operator network first needs to be established. This trust and key exchange is performed during secure provisioning, a process often performed manually and without security in mind. In OPC UA, there are already automated provisioning mechanisms planned and partly existing, but they either involve high manual effort or cannot provide mutual authentication between application and operator network. The Asset Administration Shell (AAS), as a realization of the digital twin concept, already provides the possibility of a secured data and information exchange between manufacturer and operator. In this work, we combine the security mechanisms of OPC UA and AAS to provide a more secure and automated provisioning of new OPC UA applications.",asset administration shell;OPC UA;secure provisioning,Industrial electronics;Machine-to-machine communications;Protocols;Authentication;Fourth Industrial Revolution;Digital twins;Security,IEEE Conferences

However, the recent increase in connectivity has led to an extended attack vector. Therefore, it is important that CPS are secured against current and â€” due to their long life span â€” also against future threats, such as quantum computers. The security of present communication can be broken once a sufficiently powerful quantum computer is available. To protect against this attack vector, applications and protocols should start utilizing quantum-resistant primitives. One approach that maintains common security guarantees and protects against quantum computer attacks is to use hybrid constructions: a combination of classically secure and quantum-resistant schemes. In this work, we propose a hybrid key exchange mechanism for the industrial communication protocol Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA).

Before communicating securely, it is essential that OPC UA devices are set up in a secure manner. This process is referred to as secure provisioning. An improper provisioning can lead to weak or insecure OPC UA deployments that enable adversaries to eavesdrop or even manipulate communication between industrial devices. Such insecure deployments can also be maliciously provoked by adversaries who tamper with insecure provisioning solutions. Despite secure provisioning is essential for OPC UA security and usability, there exists no overview and systematic analysis on the patchwork of different solutions in industry and academia.

In order to verify and validate (V&V) automation code before deployment in the production environment, virtual commissioning (VC) techniques have become of great interest in the last decades. Even if VC simulation approaches, based on software/hardware-in-the-loop (SiL, HiL), have shown effectiveness to V&V automation code, the continuity from the execution to the simulation layers may not be ensured due to a lack of interoperability in the toolchain. Additionally, the development of reliable component models is a complex task of the VC solution since it requires a high level of mechatronics expertise.

This paper crosses that bridge by transforming queries formulated in highly expressive QLs into lower-expressive ones to enable flexible metadata access in existing setups. We apply our methodology to an POC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) application in manufacturing and implement an open-source mapping from the expressive QL XPath. We export OPC UA information models to XML, design XPath expressions, transform these to OPC UA, and finally execute them in OPC UA with a patched client. An evaluation in a real-world injection molding application demonstrates how we, in addition to raw sensor values, dynamically capture associated metadata such as unit, scale, and precision.

A Smart Factory Web Portal (SFWP) enables secure data and service integration in cross-site application scenarios as well as `plug & work' functions for devices, machines, and data analytics software by applying industrial standards, Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA), and Automation Markup Language (AutomationML or AML for short).

Since the PS controllers adopt a TCP communication protocol, an OPC UA server with TCP driver is developed as a gateway and front controller for PS control. In order to adapt fast beam-energy change, the ""list-trigger"" strategy is applied to the PS control. BCS downloads the respective current value lists to PS controllers before the treatment, and then triggers the PS controllers by pulse signals to alter the operation current to the next value in the list during the treatment. It is vital to decide when the current regulation process is complete in the transitional period, BCS should update the current values more frequent than the steady state. Therefore, the OPC UA server adopts the node dynamic refresh scheme. A virtual simulation based on docker followed by a thorough analysis are conducted on the PS control system, where the results show the node refresh time of the OPC UA server meets the PS control requirement.

Under the condition of diversified sensor information and large amount of data need to be transmitted, traditional communication methods cannot realize real-time and reliable transmission of time-sensitive data. In view of the low real-time transmission of time-sensitive data in the current intelligent production line transmission network and the inability to adopt a reasonable scheduling method for data with different delay tolerances, this paper proposes a multi-priority real-time data transmission scheduling method (MPRTDT). This method is based on the OPC unified architecture (OPC UA) heterogeneous network equipment interconnection model, and divides the alarm data, status data, image data and video data in this model queue into 4 different priorities, and uses a mixed time slot data transmission mechanism to combine multiple time slots into a perceptual time slot (PTS). According to the different priorities of industrial data, this algorithm achieves a reasonable allocation of perceptual time slots. This model combines the queue dynamic transmission scheduling mechanism to ensure the priority transmission of high-priority real-time data such as alarm information. Simulation experiment results show that this method can provide differentiated services for different types of data, and ensures the real-time nature of time-sensitive data transmission and effectively improves the service quality level of the entire intelligent production line communication network.",OPC UA;QoS;Multi-priority;Real-time;scheduling;Heterogeneous network,Job shop scheduling;Production;Streaming media;Dynamic scheduling;Real-time systems;Data models;Heterogeneous networks,IEEE Conferences

This allows not only to detect the changes in the hardware, which appear in the production system, using the device discovery mechanisms but also automatically adapt the software. Preliminary tests have been performed on a demonstrator that shows both virtual and physical executions combined in a single system. The proposed solution supports automatic hardware and software reconfiguration on-the-fly without a need to stop and restart the whole production system.",Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems;Skill-Based Engineering;AutomationML;OPC UA,Workstations;Automation;Manufacturing systems;Software,IEEE Conferences

Frame preemption does not require scheduling, and is anticipated to simplify network configuration while providing similar guarantees in latency and jitter for high priority traffic.

Not only pose nonlinear relations a serious challenge in thermal systems engineering and optimization but real-world unit behavior furthermore changes during operation due to wear, fouling and other effects. In the present work, a novel framework for automated data-driven model adaption is presented which is capable of automating fast and accurate predictions of current system behavior. The framework is based on open protocol bidirectional live communication and mechanistic grey box modeling. While especially thermal energy storage is considered a solution to increase flexibility, it is very challenging for operation optimization. A packed bed thermal energy storage operated under severe conditions leading to continuous fouling acts as proof of concept of the proposed framework. The obtained results indicate major improvement for storage output prediction with the novel framework compared to a conventional approach without readjustment.
