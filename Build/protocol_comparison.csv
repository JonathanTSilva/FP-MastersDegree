5,"Concurrent OPC UA information model access, enabling real-time OPC UA PubSub","Ongoing changes in industrial automation aim to-wards a flat and highly interconnected architecture that includes end-to-end real-time enabled machine-to-machine communications. Several technologies, such as OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) publish-subscribe and time-sensitive networking (TSN), facilitate that change. While OPC UA PubSub and TSN can already provide real-time capabilities, the parallel operation with standard OPC UA client-server remains an open challenge. This article presents preliminary results for solving concurrent information model access between OPC UA PubSub and client-server. The results include the overall RT-TSN-OPC UA concept, an analysis of common concurrent data access mechanisms for their suitability, and identifying critical code segments in the open62541 OPC UA stack. The paper concludes by outlining further research focusing on implementing and evaluating a wait-and obstruction-free mechanism into open62541."
15,A CoAP-based OPC UA Transmission Scheme for Resource-Constrained Devices,"The Industrial Internet continuously covers all aspects of smart manufacturing. As an enabling technology for Industrial Internet, OPC UA protocol realizes the information modeling and unified description of industry devices. Furthermore, OPC UA supports data access through Web services based on HTTP. However, the high resource cost of HTTP for resource-constrained devices is hard to afford. The CoAP protocol is specially designed for resource-constrained devices, and it has better suitability in the IoT environment than HTTP. Therefore, an efficient and lightweight transmission scheme, which is applied to realize the transfer of OPC UA messages over the CoAP protocol, is proposed in this paper. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme realizes the effective transmission of resource-constrained device data through the Web service interface via OPC UA."
21,Extended gateway model for OPC UA/IoT device integration,"In the paper, we share our research results and experiences with the industrial integration of IoT devices and OPC UA systems, assuming it is one of major enablers for Industry 4.0 use-cases. The main focus is paid on the numerical model of integration gateway, which could enable integration of various IoT devices, embedded and constrained systems, where implementation of full-scale OPC UA protocol is not possible. The goal is to create the appropriate model for OPC UA/IoT device integrations, verify and test it with implemented integration gateway. The gateway implementation scope and testing was concentrated on OPC DA and two major IoT protocols: MQTT and COAP."
26,Development of OPC UA based centralized server Fieldbus data high efficiency transmit architecture,"In last few years industrial communication system is one of the most important innovations in factory and process automation systems. Many applications of industrial control are changing as communication technology advances, this also brings new opportunities and challenges to fieldbus system. In this paper, we proposed one new fieldbus data transmit architecture. The proposed architecture includes one OPC UA (OPC Unified Architecture) based centralized server, it used to replace the traditional fieldbus direct connection between fieldbus master station and PLC. The high capacity and high-speed characteristics of OPC UA structure are utilized to realize efficient and high timeliness fieldbus data transmission. Under this architecture, we propose a concept of data converter, it used to provide high compatibility with old and new fieldbus devices to reduce the cost of automation system upgrading. Proposed architecture has obvious advantages in multi PLC joint work environment."
28,Construction of Industrial Internet of Things Based on MQTT and OPC UA Protocols,"At present, the Internet of Things has become a hot area of global concern and is considered to be another major scientific and technological innovation after the Internet. The Internet of Things can be analyzed from two aspects, one is to access the Internet, and the other is the connection between things. The Industrial Internet of Things, as a new type of industrial ecosystem, collects resources and data during the industrial production process by using miniature low-cost controllers and high-bandwidth wireless networks to achieve flexible configuration of manufacturing raw materials and improve resource utilization. The Industrial Internet of Things not only includes traditional software elements, but also requires hardware controllers and sensors, as well as cloud service platforms, to ultimately achieve intelligent manufacturing. The Industrial Internet of Things based on MQTT adopts the method of upper computer (WeChat applet) + server (Alibaba Cloud Server) + lower computer (WiFi module ESP8266 NodeMcu) to realize data collection and control of industrial production process. Based on OPC UA protocol, The Industrial Internet of Things, by designing an intelligent node device based on embedded Linux system, uses Qt to build the OPC UA protocol. OPC UA is a C / S architecture real-time database framework. By building an OPC UA Client on a handheld terminal device, An OPC UA Serve is set up on the smart terminal device, and the information collected by the handheld terminal is sent to the smart terminal. At the same time, multiple smart terminals are connected through the OPC UA protocol to perform data interaction and information transfer. At the same time, an edge computing algorithm is embedded in the smart terminal, and a large amount of data collected is processed for analysis, screening, and calculation. At the same time, the processed information is transmitted or processed. Reduce data interactions between data sources and data centers, and reduce the amount of information transmitted and stored."
48,An industrial feedback on the use of OPC UA for the vertical integration of semiconductor front-ends,"As manufacturing, in general, is adopting Industry 4.0, OPC UA is gaining traction to become the de facto architecture for overcoming the issues of interoperability. Even though semiconductor equipment manufacturers need to comply with the existing and now mature SEMI11SEMI is a semiconductor association that defines standards. All SEMI standards referenced in this article are accessible at https://www.semi.org standards, it is worthwhile to explore the possibilities of harmonizing them with other automation standards. Following the same motivation, OPC Foundation has developed standardized companion specifications for different other standards like ISA-95, PROFINET, IO-Link, etc. In the absence of a companion specification for semiconductor industry, this work compares the architectural choices for the development of an information model for semiconductor industry. We share the lessons learned from our endeavors in implementing OPC UA information models for semiconductor domain."
58,Performance Comparison Between OPC UA and MQTT for Data Exchange,"With the new concepts brought by the Industry 4.0 and the Internet of Things (IoT), it is expected more equipment communicating with each other, using local and cloud computing servers. In order to the communication between the devices be efficient, fast and with time deterministic, it is necessary to choose a suitable network protocol. In this context, the article presents the performance comparison of quantity of used data and time spent to send and receive messages in two well-known protocols in the field of IoT and Industrial loT (IIoT): MQTT and OPC UA. The obtained values show the advantages of using each protocol in several scenarios, in order to exploit the best data exchange between devices."
59,Design and Implementation of OPC UA Server Based on SECS/GEM Protocol,"In order to solve the problem of incompatibility of communication data between semiconductor manufacturing industry and other automation industries, a design scheme of OPC UA server development based on SEMI Equipment Communications Standard/Generic Model for Communications (SECS/GEM) was proposed. The design idea and workflow of the whole system are described in detail. After testing, the server has completed real-time communication with the third-party SECS/GEM equipment simulation software and UA client, and solved the problem that the data message in the communication process of semiconductor equipment is not compatible with OPC UA specification."
60,Real-time Industrial Communication by using OPC UA Field Level Communication,"Real-time behaviour is one of the most important aspects of field level automation networks in factory communication. Various Real-Time Ethernet (RTE) technologies have been developed over the years to cope with the network requirements like latency, Quality-of-Service (QoS), reliability etc. of the field level networks. Because of their nature of vendor-dependency, these technologies have been incompatible with one another. In the era of Industry 4.0, an innovative approach is required to bring together this technology in order to solve the interoperability issue. Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture (OPC UA) is a vendor-neutral communication protocol which can be an answer to this incompatibility problem of field level factory networks. This paper aims to use OPC UA as a field level communication protocol in combination with the Time-sensitive networking (TSN) standards to simulate the real-time behaviour of field network."
75,Towards an OPC UA Compliant Programming Approach with Formal Model of Computation for Dynamic Reconfigurable Automation Systems,"This paper proposes Service Oriented SystemJ - OPC UA (SOSJ - OPC UA), a service-oriented programming approach which targets dynamic industrial manufacturing systems. An extension of SOSJ, SOSJ - OPC UA utilizes OPC UA standard to introduce service orientation, enable interoperability with different actors in the systems, and compliance with Reference Architecture Model for Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) which defines OPC UA as the communication standard. The paper begins by describing new concept on the synergy of SOSJ and OPC UA. Then, SOA information exchange mechanisms which utilize OPC UA are defined that enable parties to find each other. SOSJ - OPC UA is then demonstrated in a simple manufacturing example to demonstrate its capability."
83,An Efficient Configuration Scheme of OPC UA TSN in Industrial Internet,"TSN plays an important role in industrial Internet due to its bounded low latency and high reliability. In order to have TSN worked in practical applications, it is urgent to study the configuration of TSN. Based on the standard of IEEE 802.1 Qcc, we propose a configuration scheme of OPC UA TSN, describe the functionality and procedure of the scheme in detail. We verify that our configuration scheme can satisfy the bounded delay requests of periodic time-sensitive data flows."
84,A Comparison of OPC UA & Semantic Web Languages for the purpose of Industrial Automation Applications,"The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) has revolutionized the industrial sectors around the world. Industry 4.0, a digitalization endeavour by the government of Germany for the factories of the future, aims to create intelligent, self-organized, and self-optimized smart factories by combining the IoT, cloud computing and artificial intelligence together. Interoperability is one of the crucial aspects of Industry 4.0 which requires standardized information models and exchange mechanisms for heterogeneous platform integration. Despite the development of various industry standards, this still remains the biggest burden due to multiple protocols, technologies, and policies involved. A common understanding of data semantics can be helpful in mitigating such problem. This paper provides a detailed comparison between the modelling approaches of Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture (OPC UA) and Resource Description Framework (RDF) and its extension languages. The aim is to garner a common understanding between these two modelling frameworks in order to generate a standardized mapping between them for the purpose of interoperable industrial applications."
93,Applicability of OPC UA and REST in Edge Computing,"In the last few years, the Internet of Things has expanded so much that it has been necessary to transfer part of the decision-making process from the cloud back to the local network. This article aims to design and implement an edge device at the edge of the network close to the data source to reduce latency. The edge device, in this case, will be a Raspberry Pi 3. The role of the edge device will be to manage and monitor the status of laboratory models and display model data to the client who will query these models. In this paper, the industrial protocol OPC UA and REST will be tested and compared. These will be used for communication with the edge device."
101,The Role of OPC UA TSN in IT and OT Convergence,"The Industrial Internet is a kind of infrastructure that is closely connected with people, industries, and network, and it can realize the low cost and high efficiency of intelligent production. Promoting the convergence of Information Technology (IT) and Operation Technology (OT) is the foundation to realize the Industrial Internet. However, IT and OT exist independently and cannot be unified all the time. How can they work together effectively? We describe the model of OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) and Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) in this paper that will effectively solve the problem of IT and OT convergence. We also compare three TSN models, discuss which obstacles to IT and OT convergence will be addressed by OPC UA TSN in detail, and analyze the features of OPC UA TSN. It proves that OPC UA TSN will play an important role in the process of IT and OT convergence."
106,Timing Analysis of TSN-Enabled OPC UA PubSub,"Industrial automation is changing towards a flat and highly interconnected architecture, with requirements for end-to-end real-time enabled machine-to-machine communications. Technologies such as time-sensitive networking (TSN) and OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) publish-subscribe provide the necessary features. While TSN is well explored, OPC UA's execution time behavior remains unknown. This article presents findings made while extending the open62541 OPC UA Pub Sub stack with the 802.1q VLAN tag to enable IEEE 802.1Qbv time-aware scheduling. The results include end-to-end timing measures and worst-case execution time analyses considering various payloads. Time-predictable T-CREST platforms host the publisher and subscriber, and a TSN network handles message transmission. The paper concludes by outlining further research focusing on dynamic memory access, buffer management, and the inclusion of non-priority access to the Ethernet port."
112,Evaluation and Extension of OPC UA Publish/Subscribe MQTT Binding,"Currently, Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture (OPC UA) is nominated as a reference standard to meet all Industry 4.0 demands with one protocol, enabling an efficient communication between devices in industrial systems. Recently, OPC UA has been extended by a publish/subscribe pattern to support multicast communication since there is a need for an efficient data aggregation and distribution to cope with the increasing number of controllers, sensors, and measured values in industries. Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is the most widely used publish/subscribe communication protocol and is based on a central broker for message exchange. In this paper, the communication latency of OPC UA end devices exchanging data over MQTT as a broker-based middleware is investigated and compared to the client/server-based communication. In particular, we analyze the use case of one-to-many communication for a crane model from the material handling domain. We provide a prototype implementation of the OPC UA MQTT extension and our evaluation results show the reduced traffic overhead and communication latency compared to client/server-based communication."
119,Quarry: An open source tool for OPC UA SPARQL queries over hybrid architectures using query rewriting,"OPC UA is an open set of specifications for communication and modelling that have found extensive use in industrial automation. OPC UA information models are part of the specification and are used by asset owners and equipment vendors to describe the static parameters and time varying signals belonging to equipment in standardized ways. Such descriptions are aimed to drastically reduce the cost of integrating software managing these industrial assets. Hindering the adoption of OPC UA information models is their inherent complexity and the problematic specification of query support. Previous research has implemented the OPC UA query specification using SPARQL and found that formulating queries in SPARQL natively provides shorter queries that are easier to formulate. However, parts of the OPC UA graph are time-varying, and may index large time series data sets, which are sub-optimally handled by most available SPARQL databases. We show how OPC UA can be mapped to the Semantic Web in a way that allows a hybrid approach where time series data is stored in a specialized system and describe a query rewriting approach that allows for joint queries over static OPC UA information models and time series data. Compared to existing approaches, we argue that our approach is better suited for analytics applications that require portability across infrastructure and allows a greater range of SPARQL engines. A prototype implementation called Quarry is open sourced under the Apache 2.0 license to improve the accessibility and reproducibility of this research area."
131,OPC UA PubSub Implementation and Configuration,"OPC UA (Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture) is one of the most widely used specifications for industrial system communication. In the context of increasingly complex technologies of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and requirements for interoperability of the Industrie 4.0, the specification is extended by adding a new communication architecture named PubSub to provide asynchronous information exchange capability. This paper introduces our OPC UA PubSub and MQTT based configuration tool, and a PubSub implementation that can be easily integrated into other C/C++ OPC UA projects."
146,Configurable Mapping of EtherCAT field-level devices to OPC UA,"Digital transformation in an industrial sector enables new possibilities towards economical, highly flexible and resource-saving production. Significantly involved in this transformation are standardized software interfaces to enable read and write access to the data provided by automation devices from different manufacturers. Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture (OPC UA) is a widely used industrial communication middleware and ensures interoperability between the devices. Companion specifications in OPC UA offer a possibility to map domain-specific data models to OPC UA information models. However, these specifications usually define a static mapping and often enable complete access to various field-level properties. Therefore, a configurable mapping of field-level properties to OPC UA is desirable. This paper focuses on the development and investigation of a configurable information model for mapping the EtherCAT communication standard to OPC UA. The feasibility of the configurable information model has been validated by an experimental setup composed of an embedded Personal Computer (PC) and several EtherCAT field-level devices."
160,A Unified Method to Design Bridges for OPC UA PubSub Networks in the Industrial IoT,"Specification part 14 of the Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture (OPC UA) standard provides five different profiles to implement the publish-subscribe messaging pattern. The specification is also called OPC UA PubSub, and its profiles are called PubSub profiles. Two devices deployed with the same PubSub profile can exchange and collaborate; however, two devices deployed with two different PubSub profiles are unable to communicate. It is a limit for the Industry Internet of Things, a complex environment where there would be heterogeneous devices and networks. One approach to overcoming this issue is to use a bridge for the devices deployed with different PubSub profiles. In this sense, this paper provides a unified method to design bridges for OPC UA PubSub networks. The proof-of-concept experiment, also presented in this paper, is a use case of bridging PubSub broker-less and broker-based networks."
164,An Introduction to OPC UA TSN for Industrial Communication Systems,"The industrial communication market is dominated by Ethernet-based fieldbus systems. Although they share similar requirements and market segments, their implementations and ecosystems differ considerably. As a result, end customers and device manufacturers are faced with a multitude of technologies that need to be produced, run, diagnosed, maintained, and kept in stock. Although the availability of products and services is largely satisfactory, dealing with multiple solutions generates high costs and limits IoT capability. This paper introduces Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture Time-Sensitive Networking (OPC UA TSN) as a new technology and presents the current view. This time, the industrial prospects of fulfilling industrial communication requirements while leveraging the cost benefits of standard Ethernet hardware in the midterm are in reach. We anticipate that OPC UA TSN will reveal itself as a game changer in the field of industrial automation, being a candidate for establishing a holistic communication infrastructure from the sensor to the cloud."
166,Practical Implementation of an OPC UA TSN Communication Architecture for a Manufacturing System,"In modern manufacturing systems, various industrial communication systems (e.g., fieldbus systems and industrial Ethernet networks) have been used to realize reliable information exchange. However, these industrial communication solutions are largely incompatible with each other, which do not satisfy the new requirements of Industry 4.0. Recently Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) has been developed to improve the real-time capabilities to the standard Ethernet, and is considered to be a promising real-time communication solution for Industry 4.0. In this work, we propose a communication architecture for a manufacturing system using the Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA) and TSN technologies. TSN is adopted as the communication backbone to connect heterogeneous industrial automation subsystems. The OPC UA is adopted to realize horizontal and vertical communication between subsystems in the field layer and the entities of the upper layers. We implement a laboratory-level manufacturing system to validate the proposed architecture. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and capability of the proposed architecture. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of a key TSN substandard, i.e., IEEE 802.1Qbv, in the laboratory-level manufacturing system. The evaluation results demonstrate that IEEE 802.1Qbv can indeed provide excellent real-time capabilities for industrial applications."
173,Interoperability of OPC UA PubSub with Existing Message Broker Integration Architectures,"Interoperable communication technologies are of key importance in production systems with increasing needs for data in their adoption of data-driven methodologies and new, emerging applications. OPC UA PubSub defines an alternative to the traditional client-server communication with a publish-subscribe model for data to cater to scalability and data-driven cloud application needs. In this paper, the OPC UA PubSub model is compared to some other message broker and communication technologies and integrated with an existing message based integration model for evaluating the interoperability. A case example is presented where data payloads and information security practices are integrated using an adapter approach."
174,On the Security of IIoT Deployments: An Investigation of Secure Provisioning Solutions for OPC UA,"A key technology for the communication in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is the Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA). OPC UA is a standard that enables interoperable, secure, and reliable communication between industrial devices. To defend against cyber attacks, OPC UA has built-in security mechanisms that protect the authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of data in transit. Before communicating securely, it is essential that OPC UA devices are set up in a secure manner. This process is referred to as secure provisioning. An improper provisioning can lead to weak or insecure OPC UA deployments that enable adversaries to eavesdrop or even manipulate communication between industrial devices. Such insecure deployments can also be maliciously provoked by adversaries who tamper with insecure provisioning solutions. Despite secure provisioning is essential for OPC UA security and usability, there exists no overview and systematic analysis on the patchwork of different solutions in industry and academia. This article presents the first investigation of secure device provisioning solutions for the OPC UA communication protocol. First, desired objectives and evaluation criteria for secure provisioning of OPC UA devices are defined. Next, existing and emerging OPC UA provisioning solutions are analyzed and compared based on the elaborated objectives and criteria. Additionally, an outlook into the future of OPC UA provisioning is given, based on solutions from the IoT domain. Finally, the analyzed OPC UA secure provisioning solutions are compared, recommendations are given, and research gaps are identified. It is shown that contemporary provisioning solutions offer an insufficient level of security. Emerging and future solutions provide much higher security guarantees but impose a tradeoff between usability and requirements on devices and infrastructures."
187,Industrial IoT Smartbox for the Shop Floor,"Constant search for efficiency and productivity has led to innovation on the factory shop floor, representing an evolution of the current production systems combined with new technologies of industrial automation and information technology. This work presents an experimental demo of a smartbox for Industry 4.0 scenarios, allowing sensing, monitoring and data acquisition. We have tested two different approaches, depending on the communication protocol used for real time applications: OPC UA or MQTT. Raspberry Pi's platform act as an OPC UA server or MQTT broker, respectively. From the measurements, data stored in a cloud server can be accessed remotely with improved security and visualized from a computer dashboard. One of the conclusions that can be drawn is that both protocols allow data from the smartbox to be stored and easily monitored from a smartphone application or a computer web interface. MQTT is a good option in communications requiring very low bandwidth. However, there is a lack of suitable libraries to program alarm features for OPC UA Servers."
193,"Simplifying functional safety communication in modular, heterogeneous production lines","Heterogeneous production lines as a keystone of smart factories, comprised of machines from various manufacturers, are placing a new range of demands on communication and interoperability. Connectivity is the key element for seamless data communication in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). This includes standardized protocols and interfaces as well as vendor neutral technologies. An important aspect of a production line, is functional safety and its technical implementation. Up to now, safety-relevant connections between devices of different manufacturers have been implemented using dedicated cables and line monitoring. The aim of this paper is to design an integrated safety architecture based upon existing technologies. The method proposed in this paper aims at achieving functional safety connectivity, along with non-safe data traffic, based on the vendor-neutral technologies Ethernet, Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN), and OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA)."
194,Cyber-Physical Production Systems supported by Intelligent Devices (SmartBoxes) for Industrial Processes Digitalization,"Industry 4.0 paradigm is a reality in the digitization of industrial processes and physical assets, as well as their integration into digital ecosystems with several suppliers of the value chain. In particular, Industry 4.0 is the technological evolution of embedded systems applied to Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). With this, a shift from the current paradigm of centralization to a more decentralized production, supported by Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), is implied. The work reported in this paper focuses on the development of smart devices (SmartBoxes), based on low-cost hardware such as Raspberry Pi and also platforms certified for industrial applications, such as NI CompactRIO. Both platforms adopted the OPC-UA architecture to collect data from the shop-floor and convert it into OPC-UA Data Access standard for further integration in the proposed CPPS. Tests were also performed with the MQTT protocol for monitorization. Each SmartBox is capable of real-time applications that run on OPC-UA and MQTT, allowing easy interaction between supervisory systems and physical assets."
213,Function Blocks for the Interaction with the Asset Administration Shell,"An asset administration shell (AAS), as a key concept of the Industry 4.0, provides a machine-accessible interface to any kind of asset. An application implementing the devices functionality should be able to interact with different AASs.In this work, we specify the function blocks (FBs) for accessing properties and invoking operations of AASs. We analyzed the nature and requirements of such FBs while focusing on REST/HTTP- and OPC UA-based AASs and provided IEC 61499-based implementation.The results obtained in this paper will ease interaction with the complex AAS structure from the low-level devices."
217,Towards a Real-Time Capable Plug & Produce Environment for Adaptable Factories,"Industrial manufacturing is currently undergoing a transformation from mass production with inflexible production systems to individual production with adaptable cells. In order to ensure this adaptability of these systems, technologies such as plug & produce are needed, to integrate, modify and remove devices at runtime. Therefor an exact description of the system, the products and the capabilities / skills of the devices is essential as well as a network for communication between the devices. Deterministic data transmission is particularly important for distributed control systems. We propose an architecture for plug & produce mechanisms with hard real-time capable communication paths between the cyber-physical components using OPC UA PubSub over TSN and the ability to load and execute real-time critical tasks at runtime."
222,Design and Application of Cloud Platform Based on OpenStack in Remote Online Collection and Monitoring System of Intelligent Workshop,"With the development of information technology, network technology, Internet technology, cloud computing technology and so on are more and more widely used in various industries. The traditional industrial automation hierarchy structure is complex and the integration degree is not high. It can not meet the development needs of informationization and intelligence, and is limited by the site infrastructure. Therefore, this paper designs a remote online acquisition and monitoring system architecture for intelligent workshop based on OpenStack private cloud computing, which completes the functions of data acquisition, online monitoring, database management and real-time control. In addition, this paper also considers the characteristics of the system architecture, such as filing, disaster tolerance and security. Using OPC UA protocol and Modbus RTU protocol to complete data acquisition, data interaction between the bottom of the factory and the bottom of the enterprise. At the same time, cloud computing data center centralized storage and management of the collected data, which provides great convenience for the follow-up analysis of large data in the workshop, and has a certain practical value."
235,Development of a Power Supply Control System and Virtual Simulation Based on Docker,"A proton therapy facility (HUST-PTF) based on a superconducting cyclotron is being developed by Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) and China Academy of Atomic Energy (CIAE). The beam transport system in this facility provides the required beam for the treatment rooms. The beamline control system (BCS) manages the operation of the degrader, beamline magnet power supplies (PS), diagnostics devices, etc. For additional security, BCS utilizes the OPC UA as the distributed control protocol. Since the PS controllers adopt a TCP communication protocol, an OPC UA server with TCP driver is developed as a gateway and front controller for PS control. In order to adapt fast beam-energy change, the ""list-trigger"" strategy is applied to the PS control. BCS downloads the respective current value lists to PS controllers before the treatment, and then triggers the PS controllers by pulse signals to alter the operation current to the next value in the list during the treatment. It is vital to decide when the current regulation process is complete in the transitional period, BCS should update the current values more frequent than the steady state. Therefore, the OPC UA server adopts the node dynamic refresh scheme. A virtual simulation based on docker followed by a thorough analysis are conducted on the PS control system, where the results show the node refresh time of the OPC UA server meets the PS control requirement. The virtual simulation is also proved to be cost-saving and reliable for control system tests and worth promoting."
241,Service and Agent based System Architectures for Industrie 4.0 Systems,"Industrie 4.0 is based on three pillars: Vertical Integration, Horizontal Integration and Consistency of Engineering over Product Life Cycle. The implementation of systems to realize these pillars requires an architecture enabling interoperability of distributed components and their digital representations. Potential middleware concepts for an architecture are the service-oriented architectures OPC UA, JADEX/JADEX and Arrowhead. A holistic and modular I4.0 architecture using agent technology to implement Digital Twins and thereby decouples communication middleware from processes and hardware is proposed."
248,A Comparative Study to Evaluate the Performance of Communication Protocols for Process Industry,"With the boom of Industry 4.0 for industrial automation, the data exchange between the different industrial devices has tremendously increased through local (edge) and cloud computing. Nowadays, several communication protocols are available to realize data acquisition in the industry. As a result, understanding the practical capabilities of each communication protocol arises as an essential issue in optimizing the data acquisition and storage in industrial plants. This study aims to develop a software-based test environment to evaluate the performance of two widely used communication protocols within the scope of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). These contemplated protocols are Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA) and Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT). With the help of the developed test environment, several performance metrics, like packet overhead, latency, packet loss ratio, and CPU utilization, are evaluated for different application scenarios where the varying number of clients and subscribers are considered. Derived results indicate the stronger parts of each protocol under varying communication configurations."
254,Integration of IIoT Communication Protocols in Distributed Control Applications,"Trends using Internet technologies in the industrial domain have more and more influence on the design of applications and provide more options for data exchange. This paper proposes concepts to integrate communication protocols, which are very often used in combination with IIoT, into the distributed control domain at shop floor. Originally used for vertical integration, IIoT protocols such as MQTT or OPC UA can also be used for horizontal communication between industrial devices in a distributed control system following the CPS approach. This makes it possible to adapt production processes dynamically, highly flexibly and efficiently to new requirements from a product or logistics perspective. First results show that the concepts can achieve a good transmission performance, which is sufficient for very many production processes to be automated."
272,Industrial Messaging Middleware: Standards and Performance Evaluation,"In our world due to rapid development of automotive systems, robotic systems and increasing amounts of data the question is what are the requirements for data transfer software or middleware. This document describes and compares main standards that are used in various systems of the industry. The analysis of opportunities which every standard provides is carried out. In this work, there were developed methods for testing some data transfer characteristics and tested two DDS implementations and one AMQP in inter-process communication."
