28,Construction of Industrial Internet of Things Based on MQTT and OPC UA Protocols,"At present, the Internet of Things has become a hot area of global concern and is considered to be another major scientific and technological innovation after the Internet. The Internet of Things can be analyzed from two aspects, one is to access the Internet, and the other is the connection between things. The Industrial Internet of Things, as a new type of industrial ecosystem, collects resources and data during the industrial production process by using miniature low-cost controllers and high-bandwidth wireless networks to achieve flexible configuration of manufacturing raw materials and improve resource utilization. The Industrial Internet of Things not only includes traditional software elements, but also requires hardware controllers and sensors, as well as cloud service platforms, to ultimately achieve intelligent manufacturing. The Industrial Internet of Things based on MQTT adopts the method of upper computer (WeChat applet) + server (Alibaba Cloud Server) + lower computer (WiFi module ESP8266 NodeMcu) to realize data collection and control of industrial production process. Based on OPC UA protocol, The Industrial Internet of Things, by designing an intelligent node device based on embedded Linux system, uses Qt to build the OPC UA protocol. OPC UA is a C / S architecture real-time database framework. By building an OPC UA Client on a handheld terminal device, An OPC UA Serve is set up on the smart terminal device, and the information collected by the handheld terminal is sent to the smart terminal. At the same time, multiple smart terminals are connected through the OPC UA protocol to perform data interaction and information transfer. At the same time, an edge computing algorithm is embedded in the smart terminal, and a large amount of data collected is processed for analysis, screening, and calculation. At the same time, the processed information is transmitted or processed. Reduce data interactions between data sources and data centers, and reduce the amount of information transmitted and stored."
35,Design of Integrated Energy System Based on IEC 61499 and OPC UA,"Integrated Energy System (IES) is a key component of energy internet, which has made great progress in multi-energy supplementation, energy conservation and emission reduction. IEC 61499 standard and OPC UA communication are powerful cyber-physical system technologies for dynamic reconfiguration, interoperability, and integrability. In this paper, we propose a modular design and development approach for IES, based on the reconfiguration-supporting distributed architecture of IEC 61499. For data integration and transmission, we use OPC UA on the communication level to support multiple devices and communication protocols. The program design is implemented on an IEC 61499 compliant software platform. We build a photovoltaic simulation system with real-time electric meter data acquisition through an OPC UA gateway device. Experimental and simulation results show that the proposed approach is effective in realizing a unified, robust and efficient integrated energy control system."
36,On automatic generation of OPC UA connections in IEC 61499 automation systems,"Demand for customization and the need to adapt to rapidly changing global markets have increased the demand for digitalization and intelligent manufacturing. Unlike traditional factories, smart factories aim for high digitalization and efficiency of IT technology adoption. The digital twin is a major enabler of the smart factory. Digital twin provides virtual models, cloud services and data connections among real and virtual components. The engineered kinematics of virtual models must dynamically behave like physical elements. This paper proposes an algorithm and implements the software tool for the automatic generation of OPC UA connections between the IEC 61499-based control application and the OPC UA server. The main contribution is that virtual models can easily and quickly subscribe to published Input/Output (I/O) variables via OPC UA standard."
42,Transforming OPC UA Information Models into Domain-Specific Ontologies,"Semantics interoperability is important for cyber-physical systems to enable complex data processing and facilitating interworking. OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) provides an extensible information model but lacks formal semantics. Ontologies based on the Web Ontology Language (OWL) can provide such formal semantics. Thus, we present a transformation approach that converts OPC UA information models (or only parts of them) into domain-specific ontologies. The transformation process consists of two steps. The first step is a mapping from OPC UA to OWL Full. The second step performs a graph transformation, based on SPARQL rules, into the domain-specified target ontology. The adaption of this transformation to the source information model and the target ontology can be accomplished by only adapting these transformation rules. The presented approach is evaluated for a use case of an industrial heating process to show its flexibility."
45,Web-Platform for Developing Man-Machine Interfaces Based on OPC UA,"The fields that have had more development in recent years have been web development and automation as a result of the emergence of new technologies such as the Internet of Things and Industry 4.0. That is why it shows a proposal for a web platform for the creation of Man-Machine Interfaces (MMI) at low-cost and high-performance based on the ISA 101 standard. All of these thanks to the advantages that new technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript have provided in the field of the development of mobile applications and for the integration of information from the shop floor using the OPC UA protocol. The proposed platform may be used by web-users to exchange data with OPC UA Server without any knowledge of the standard."
51,Design and Implementation of the Substation Intelligent Auxiliary Control System Based on OPC UA,"At present, the traditional substation auxiliary control system is faced with the following four problems: poor real-time capability to abnormal response, high dependence on people when solving malfunctions, the communication, deployment and expansion of different underlying devices, and the lack of security mechanism. To solve these problems or optimize the functions, an intelligent substation auxiliary control system is proposed. The system innovatively applies OPC UA to the construction of the auxiliary control system. First, through the use of OPC UA's unique object-oriented modeling method as well as the joint specification modeling of OPC UA and IEC61850, to solve the data communication problems caused by heterogeneous devices. Second, applying the Client/Server mode to realize the remote access from authorized mobile clients and give instructions, to cope with abnormal conditions, which reduces the dependency on people. Clients of other authorized enterprises are allowed to access the working data of the devices they are interested in, makes full use of massive data and ensures the information security of the system. Third, Pub/Sub mode is applied to enable the underlying devices to communicate directly with each other through the middleware, which reduces the response time of equipment joint debugging and improve the real-time performance. In addition, through OPC UA, the industrial data of the system can be transmitted over the Internet, realizing the combination of the Internet of Things and the Internet, which is an idea of the combination of the two in the future."
52,Cross-Platform Device Monitoring System Based on OPC UA,"With the development of data monitoring system for industrial equipment, the convenience of data monitoring is paid more and more attention. Traditional data monitoring mostly uses specialized software or visual interface on the device to achieve the purpose of monitoring data, the workflow will be more complex. Even if there is a unified device to receive the data, it is not realistic to monitor all the time. In addition, for the load problem of the micro device, mounting the OPC UA client by itself is heavy. Therefore, in order to improve the visibility of field device data, reduce the load of micro devices and simplify the complex workflow, this paper studies the cross-platform device monitoring system based on OPC UA. The local OPC UA server is used to collect data from industrial devices, and the collected data is processed and transferred to the cloud storage system. The stateless RESTful HTTP request style simplifies the complexity of implementing data transfer between a generic client (browser or other HTTP client) and a Web server, and truly enables users to monitor data anytime and anywhere without consuming too many resources."
55,Reasoning over OPC UA Information Models using Graph Embedding and Reinforcement Learning,"With the fourth industrial revolution, the OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) has emerged as the standard communication framework for the implementation of cyber-physical production systems since it can be used for both, communication and information modeling. Even though OPC UA helps bridge the interoperability gap at the automation level, its semantic has not yet been formally defined and generated or manually created OPC UA information models are often incomplete and inconsistent making an efficient automated reasoning and knowledge inference on the OPC UA address space particularly challenging.In this paper, we show that it is possible to train a machine learning system on OPC UA information models, such that it performs automated reasoning over OPC UA knowledge graphs with high precision and recall. More specifically, we present a reinforcement learning based solution that learns to reason on semantically incomplete OPC UA information models by constructing multi-hop relational paths along an embedded vector space of the knowledge graph representing the information model. The construction of such relational paths allows the discovery of missing relations between the entities and at the same time the evaluation of the truth of the encoded triples, thus enabling consistency checks and questions answering."
56,Towards building OPC-UA companions for semi-conductor domain,"Semi-conductor industry have been handling for decades some of Industry 4.0 concepts mainly related to the remote control and the monitoring of the equipment and devices. In such industries, production jobs are launched on aggregated set of equipment responsible of the execution of the production process. Each equipment is controlled by a host. Such configurations allow the semi-conductor fabs to be highly flexible since jobs are not constrained to a single machine and a single machine can process several times the same product. SECS/GEM (SEMI Equipment Communications Standard/Generic Equipment Model) standards define the minimum specifications for the equipment/host interfaces. In this paper, we assess SECS/GEM standards against Industry 4.0 communication architecture OPC-UA. We show the complementarity between both standards and propose an approach to translate the specifications stacks of SECS/GEM standards towards OPC-UA information models. We first build UML models from which we generate services that must be exhibited by the host and the equipment interfaces and then we generate from these UML models specific OPC-UA address space model for SECS/GEM that will be deployed on OPC-UA servers and accessible by OPC-UA clients."
61,Modelling Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems using IEC 61499 and OPC UA,"Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (iCPS) are considered as the enabling technology for achieve Industry 4.0. One main characteristic of the iCPS is the information transparency to allow interoperability among various devices and systems. The OPC UA provides a common information model for connecting Industry 4.0 components. On the other hand, the IEC 61499 is commonly used as an executable modeling language for iCPS. The IEC 61499 function block network provides an abstract view of the system configuration. By combining IEC 61499 and OPC UA, a visual executable model for iCPS is completed. In this paper, the mapping between two standards are provided and a case study of the proposed mapping is given."
62,A Smart Gateway Enabling OPC UA and DDS Interoperability,"Interoperability is one of the major challenges of adoption of the Industrial Internet of Things. OPC UA is one of the main industrial standards for the Request-reply messaging pattern, and DDS is one of the main industrial standards for the Publish-subscribe messaging pattern. How to ensure data is communicated, understandable, and interoperable between the systems implemented by OPC UA and DDS is an industrial concern to address. This study proposes a novel middleware solution which enables effective communication between these two message patterns. We evaluate our work by testing the middleware's performance on a scenario using a Raspberry Pi and the software middleware connected to a private LAN, measuring response times and reliability."
67,Introduction of Group-Subscriptions for RESTful OPC UA clients in IIoT environments,"In the automation domain, OPC UA can be considered one of the most important communication protocols for IIoT applications. According to a study of McKinsey the potential economic impact of the IoT within factories may reach up to 3,7 Trillion Dollar by 2025. To unlock this potential it is very important to bridge the interoperability gap. Since V1.04 OPC UA also supports session-less clients and therefore allows the development of RESTful clients which can be used to address the cross-domain interoperability issue. However, currently, RESTful clients cannot use Subscriptions, because the corresponding Service Sets are not supported for session-less clients. In this paper, we will present how Subscriptions can be introduced for session-less clients. Furthermore, we outline how Group-Subscriptions can be introduced for session-less as well as session-based clients. Finally, our evaluation shows that Group-Subscriptions significantly outperform standard Subscriptions if the Subscription can be shared by several clients."
78,Skill-based Engineering Approach using OPC UA Programs,"The modern manufacturing and production systems are changing into a flexible factory layout that raises a demand for distributed control systems, where various components from different vendors communicating over their capabilities (skills) to execute a production task. This paper offers a way of how the skills, offered by an automation system component, can be represented using a generic interface to allow the higher control levels to easily orchestrate the skills available in the system and control their execution in the runtime. We show how a skill can be modeled using a Finite State Machine and present a concrete example how the concept can be realized by means of the OPC UA communication protocol."
83,An Efficient Configuration Scheme of OPC UA TSN in Industrial Internet,"TSN plays an important role in industrial Internet due to its bounded low latency and high reliability. In order to have TSN worked in practical applications, it is urgent to study the configuration of TSN. Based on the standard of IEEE 802.1 Qcc, we propose a configuration scheme of OPC UA TSN, describe the functionality and procedure of the scheme in detail. We verify that our configuration scheme can satisfy the bounded delay requests of periodic time-sensitive data flows."
90,Remote Two-wheel Robot control using OPC-UA,"In this work, we have implemented the two networked robots that can be reproduced in real time. The two robots formed a network by applying OPC-UA and send location and heading angle information periodically between each robot for lightweight communication environment and object modeling Robot 1 is controlled by the user, and Robot 2 calculates a smoothed traveling path to move from its current position to an updated position and heading angle sent from Robot 1. The results show that the automatically-moving robot's trajectory are close to the manually controlled robot's trajectory, and the average communication delay is 20 msec or less."
94,Applications of OPC UA Client Server Mode on EPICS Researches,"The Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS) is a standard development tool and middleware for the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) of large scientific projects. If EPICS exchanges data with different SCADA, the problem need to be solved by a communication specification. We choose Object Linking and Embedding for Process Control Unified Architecture (OPC UA) Client Server mode as the data exchange interface between EPICS and other SCADA. In this paper we use LabVIEW to develop related applications and test them in simulated industrial Ethernet. The test results meet the data exchange requirements between different SCADA, and the method provides an effective solution for the data exchange problems of large scientific projects."
127,Trends in industrial communication and OPC UA,The paper deals with trends in industrial communication and with the question how to integrate existing communication and information technologies into automation. What new solutions OPC UA offers to today's modern industry? And how to capture the complex issue of Industry 4.0 in education? Answers to these questions are very important today.
128,Implementing OPC-UA services for Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems in Service-Oriented Architecture,"Industrial cyber-physical systems are advancing rapidly along with the emergence of the fourth industrial revolution. It is, therefore, necessary to design and develop appropriate tools and frameworks that allow the migration/integration of legacy systems into the new Industry 4.0 environment. OPC-UA is one of the recommended technologies to enable communication and interoperability of digitalized assets in Industry 4.0. This paper proposes a solution to develop an OPC-UA interface for industrial systems for service-oriented architecture. With the use of the Arrowhead Framework - a cloud-based framework facilitating interoperability and integrability of Industrial Internet of Things - and Industry 4.0-compliant technologies, the authors describe the procedure of developing different application systems which dynamically produce and consume OPC-UA services within a local automation cloud."
129,OPC UA Service Discovery and Binding in a Service-Oriented Architecture,"The OPC UA (Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture) technology is found in many industrial applications as it addresses many of Industry 4.0's requirements. One of its appeals is its service-oriented architecture. Nonetheless, it requires engineering efforts during deployment and maintenance to bind or associate the correct services to a client or consumer system. We propose the integration of OPC UA with the Eclipse Arrowhead Framework (EAF) to enable automatic service discovery and binding at runtime, reducing delays, costs, and errors. The integration also enables the client system to get the service endpoints by querying the service attributes or metadata. Moreover, this forms a bridge to other industrial communication technologies such as Modbus TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) as the framework is not limited to a specific protocol. To demonstrate the idea, an indexed line with an industrial PLC (programmable logic controller) with an OPC UA server is used to show that the desired services endpoints are revealed at runtime when querying their descriptive attributes or metadata through the EAF's Orchestrator system."
152,An Industrie 4.0 compliant and self-managing OPC UA Aggregation Server,"Gaining value out of data provided in industrial application in a standardized Industrie 4.0 compliant way is a challenging and time-extensive task. Not only does the data need to be integrated into a data platform, it also needs to be described and integrated in an appropriate way, that allows a standardized processing for its value-added services. One way to achieve this, lies in the use of OPC UA and the asset administration shell. Together they can implement an Industrie 4.0 Component as the standardized service for tailored data integration and usage. Data in OPC UA is available in different levels of abstraction, both in terms of the data and its description. Rarely is the asset administration shell (AAS) considered in this context. This paper will introduce a first approach to harmonize OPC UA and the AAS in an I4.0 compliant Aggregation Server. The server is able to aggregate information models based on the current meta model mapping of the AAS, regardless of whether the base servers implement this or not. Moreover the aggregated server can route OPC UA services down to the base servers and is managing itself in case of discovery and information aggregation. This approach can be used as the standalone interface for data integration in respective data platforms."
186,Accessing and Interpreting OPC UA Event Traces based on Semantic Process Descriptions,"The analysis of event data from production systems is the basis for many applications associated with Industry 4.0. However, heterogeneous and disjoint data is common in this domain. As a consequence, contextual information of an event might be incomplete or improperly interpreted which results in suboptimal analysis results. This paper proposes an approach to access a production systems' event data based on the event data's context (such as the product type, process type or process parameters). The approach extracts filtered event logs from a database system by combining: 1) a semantic model of a production systemâ€™s hierarchical structure, 2) a formalized process description and 3) an OPC UA information model. As a proof of concept we demonstrate our approach using a sample server based on OPC UA for Machinery Companion Specifications."
221,Digital power system data transmission framework and configuration design,"Energy digitization and intelligence have jointly promoted the transformation and upgrading of the power system. As the industrial system with the largest scale and the most complex structure, the power system has higher requirements for the real-time and certainty of data transmission. Digital twin technology can realize real-time monitoring, analysis, and prediction of power systems through technical means such as intelligent perception, real-time transmission, virtual-real interaction, and artificial intelligence. Based on the digital twin technology, this paper proposes a five-layer model architecture of the digital power system. At the same time, combined with the relevant standards of OPC UA and TSN, a TSN configuration scheme that meets the needs of digital power systems is designed, which can effectively improve the real-time performance of data transmission."
223,Analyzing Manufacturing Data in a Digital Control Room Making Use of Semantic Annotations,"The German manufacturing industry carries out new developments towards Industry 4.0, which focus on smart factories and smart assistance systems. In this paper, we present our digital control room for analyzing manufacturing data aiming at optimizing production processes. It builds upon our digital boardroom - a multi-display environment integrating multitouch and multiuser-based annotation dashboards so that decision makers gain insights into and can discuss an organization's data. In particular, our digital control room integrates the OPC UA protocol, semantic annotations, and a time series database to analyze, visualize and interact with machine data. Thereby, it can combine real time, near-real time, and batch processing of machine data and constitutes a holistic business intelligence environment."
237,A Unified Architecture for Industrial IoT Security Requirements in Open Platform Communications,"We present a unified communication architecture for security requirements in the industrial internet of things. Formulating security requirements in the language of OPC UA provides a unified method to communicate and compare security requirements within a heavily heterogeneous landscape of machines in the field. Our machine-readable data model provides a fully automatable approach for security requirement communication within the rapidly evolving fourth industrial revolution, which is characterized by high-grade interconnection of industrial infrastructures and self-configuring production systems. Capturing security requirements in an OPC UA compliant and unified data model for industrial control systems enables strong use cases within modern production plants and future supply chains. We implement our data model as well as an OPC UA server that operates on this model to show the feasibility of our approach. Further, we deploy and evaluate our framework within a reference project realized by 14 industrial partners and 7 research facilities within Germany."
239,"Supporting the Design, Commissioning and Supervision of Smart Factory Components through their Digital Twin","In a context of greater complexity of Smart Factories, the commissioning time for automated systems needs to be shortened. The use of virtual commissioning tools is a good contribution to achieve this goal. Ideally, those tools should be part of a virtual engineering environment sharing same virtual model, the digital twin, through the complete lifecycle of the automated system, namely the project, simulation, implementation and execution/monitoring/supervision and, eventually decommissioning phases. Such vision includes a digital twin with a broader use, which is consistent with the real system and one that can be used after the early design and commissioning phases. Finding a complete set of tools able to comply with the above requirements can be extremely challenging. In this paper we explore the use of the ABB RobotStudio software combined with the OPC UA standard with this vision in mind. Methodologies were defined to integrate both new generation and legacy equipment, as well as robot controllers and guidelines for equipment development. A key result of this work is the development of a set of virtual engineering tools and methodologies based on OPC UA and implemented using RobotStudio in order to accomplish the complete lifecycle support of an automated system, from the project and simulation phases, to the monitoring and supervision phases, suitable for integration in Industry 4.0 factories. Results are described for a test scenario with different devices."
240,A Real-time Computation Task Reconfiguration Mechanism for Industrial Edge Computing,"The growth of massive generated data from the industrial field results in performance reduction on network bandwidth, real-time response, and communication latency. For distributed industrial automation systems, edge computing suits better than cloud computing from real-time constraints purpose. Furthermore, the integration of OPC UA in edge computing nodes improves interoperability and compatibility. This paper focuses on computation task reconfiguration issues among physically neighboring nodes based on OPC UA. Considering the high real-time requirement in industrial edge computing, a task reconfiguration mechanism is proposed and a real-time workload reallocation algorithm for optimization without any iteration process. Finally, a case study on a triplex reciprocating pump with a multi-class faults simulation model proves that it can improve task execution efficiency without worsening classification accuracy much."
247,AASPMP: Design and Implementation of Production Management Platform Based on AAS,"Intelligent transformation for traditional factories is a widely discussed topic. The key to this transformation is ensuring the integration between information technology and operational technology. However, it is a challenging task in industry owing to the communication heterogeneity of the underlying production equipment (horizontal communication), and inefficient interactions between the equipment and information decision center (vertical communication). In this paper, we explore asset administration shell (AAS), an asset virtualization technology, shielding heterogeneous physical communication protocol of production equipment. Besides, to promote inefficient communication between the equipment and information decision center, we adapt OPC UA protocol as the communication protocol of AAS for vertical communication. In addition, time-sensitive networking (TSN) is applied to ensure communication between the AAS and the corresponding physical device. Above operations ensure devices interconnection and interoperability. On this basis, we propose an AAS-based production management platform (AASPMP), which aims at the coverage from the demand side to the production side. Such an intelligent system characterizes three layers to decompose complicated system functionalities, and a visible client is provided for the convenience of remote operation and maintenance. We deploy our system on the actual production system and demonstrate the effectiveness of our design."
255,Interactive Visual Procedure using an extended FMEA and Mixed-Reality,"In this paper, an application is created for the HoloLens, a headgear that enables users to experience mixed reality. The application proves that it is plausible to create an interactive visual guide in the form of a Unity application, in order to support operators with the fault detection assessment of a machine. This application utilizes WorldAnchors and a Vuforia engine to fix the holograms spatially. It shows the steps to solve detected faults through holograms and CAD models. The troubleshooting steps are modelled using an extended Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) as a knowledge extraction method. This method extracts expert knowledge from the operators in a systematic way, as well as it maps the faults with the current feed of the machine data. Users can interact with buttons through the guide on the HoloLens until the fault is solved. The fault detection system is located in a software framework, which collects data from the machine using the OPC-UA communication protocol. This system is proven to be useful, as well as it has a low latency of 51 ms."
256,On Developing a Collaborative and Interoperable Mobile Production Platform for an Agile Factory: A Case Study,"This paper reports on the development of a ""mobile production platform"" (MPP), which comprises a mobile robot with lifting capability and an ABB IRB14000 YuMI precision robot mounted on top of it. The MPP is capable of moving to different locations in the production space to perform production. Different programming languages and specification standards are used such as the graphical IEC 61499 language, Robot Operating System (ROS), and ABB's Rapid language. To allow easy communication with other actors programmed in different languages on the factory floor, the MPP utilizes the well-known OPC UA, the communication standard defined by the Reference Architectural Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0)."
260,An Approach for Data Pipeline with Distributed Query Engine for Industrial Applications,"The data driven services in industrial automation systems are transforming the world of automation industry by optimizing industrial processes and providing Value Added Services (VASs) with the grace of Industry 4.0, Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI). A demand driven data pipeline is essential to connect different industrial data sources in a shop floor with different data storage systems for service provisioning. This paper analyzes an experimental approach and corresponding challenges to optimize computing resource allocation in industrial applications to construct such demand driven data pipeline to provide data driven services through an open source, flexible and extensible distributed query engine known as Presto, which can perform interactive analytical queries for different purposes such as condition monitoring, asset management or many others."
261,Research on Multi-priority Real-time Data Transmission Scheduling Method for Intelligent Production Line,"In the communication process of network equipment on the intelligent production line, there are different kinds of fault operation and maintenance data, which have different requirements on transmission volume and real-time performance. Under the condition of diversified sensor information and large amount of data need to be transmitted, traditional communication methods cannot realize real-time and reliable transmission of time-sensitive data. In view of the low real-time transmission of time-sensitive data in the current intelligent production line transmission network and the inability to adopt a reasonable scheduling method for data with different delay tolerances, this paper proposes a multi-priority real-time data transmission scheduling method (MPRTDT). This method is based on the OPC unified architecture (OPC UA) heterogeneous network equipment interconnection model, and divides the alarm data, status data, image data and video data in this model queue into 4 different priorities, and uses a mixed time slot data transmission mechanism to combine multiple time slots into a perceptual time slot (PTS). According to the different priorities of industrial data, this algorithm achieves a reasonable allocation of perceptual time slots. This model combines the queue dynamic transmission scheduling mechanism to ensure the priority transmission of high-priority real-time data such as alarm information. Simulation experiment results show that this method can provide differentiated services for different types of data, and ensures the real-time nature of time-sensitive data transmission and effectively improves the service quality level of the entire intelligent production line communication network."
268,IoT Retrofitting Approach for the Food Industry,"Industrial food production is one of the biggest businesses that supplies most of the food consumed by the world. Despite being one of the largest industries, the lack of appropriate control and quality due to inefficient food management results in a lot of waste and cost ineffectiveness. With the emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) and Industry 4.0, the food industry can be benefited by adapting to these concepts and enhance the desirable quality of the products. In this paper, an advanced quality check method has been proposed by identifying influencing process parameters and proposes a retrofitting architecture for existing machines by implementing a hardware device capable of collecting vast amount of process data and integrating them with a cloud platform for further analysis."
269,Digital Twins for Manufacturing Using UML and Behavioral Specifications,"Using digital twins, physical manufacturing objects can be virtualized and represented as digital models which are seamlessly integrated in both the physical and the digital space. This allows to simulate, verify and optimize production systems, from the logistical aspects to the manufacturing process and the involved components. A key challenge, in this area, is how to describe digital twins in complex manufacturing systems such that all physical details, processes, and verification needs are modeled at an appropriate and efficient abstraction level, e.g., modeling and detecting divers faults in production processes. To address this challenge, in this paper we present our work on modeling digital twins of manufacturing facilities using UML. UML class diagrams are used to describe static dependencies between entities, as well as to monitor and analyze the dynamic verification and quality aspects of manufacturing such as fault detection and consistency checks. Utilizing the key relevant features of UML in our approach, the designed class diagrams are used and enriched with behavioral models serving as digital twins which can be updated by live data from the manufacturing plant. We present a small example based on simulation programs and a demonstrator. The presented modeling approach and example provide useful insights to UML-based design of digital twins in complex manufacturing systems."
275,Standardization of Edge Configuration,"The Industrial Internet of Things requires standardization of communication technologies and protocols applied in that context. An emerging architectural concept is the so called ""Edge"" and its associated components and applications. The Edge Computing paradigm requires standardization of interfaces to enable cross-vendor interoperability between the different involved products and across the architectural layers. The current results in this direction of the ""Labs Network Industrie 4.0"" pre-standardization testbed will be presented in this paper and a brief overview given on further organizations working on the standardization of implementations in the edge context."
293,Using a model-based engineering approach for developing Industrial Internet of Things applications,"A new trend in the manufacturing sector, better known by the term â€œIndustry 4.0â€, will influence all areas and increase the complexity of production processes, product development, maintenance and disposal. The integration of information and communication technologies (ICT) and the advantages of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) will result in automation processes aiming to optimize efficiency or reduce expenses. However, this results in the emergence of on-demand manufacturing as well as the provision of personalized goods and services, produced in the context of shortened innovation cycles. Ho wever, the downside of this trend is the uprising complexity that appears when engineering such systems. Thus, the Reference Architecture Model Industry 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) has been developed by several German associations in order to cope with the complexity of such cross-disciplinary systems. However, at the current point of view, this framework is exhibiting a gap between the architectural model and actual industrial applications. Thus, this paper introduces an approach proposing Round-trip Engineering (RTE) of previously modeled industrial system components. In order to do so, first the information and communication architecture is modeled according to the specifications of RAMI 4.0 and by utilizing OPC UA. Subsequently, the modeled components are generated and applied with the help of FREDOSAR, an open-source system architecture aimed for the application in such a complex system. In the end, data exchange between RAMI 4.0 and the industrial application is established by realizing a bidirectional interface, which is evaluated with a typical industrial case study."
