The water infrastructure and generally automation/SCADA systems may be vulnerable to attacks. In case of critical infrastructures, the protection is necessary because an eventual successful attack can cause major damages. The paper presents a solution for protecting water pumping stations from threats using a honeypot inside an OPC UA wrapping structure. As known, Industry 4.0 and Industrial Internet of Things concepts are moving the industry towards interoperability and interoperation. OPC UA is the defined and widely accepted interfacing solution. The transition to OPC UA for both new and legacy systems can be realized through wrappers, such middleware protocol conversion and data wrapping structures are studied and developed. The proposed honeypot is conceived for Node-RED based applications being able to access Modbus, S7, OPC UA local structures and exposing tags in OPC UA server.

The original defense system has been unable to effectively resist the current risk. Illegal network monitoring, network intrusion attack, theft, tampering, network terrorism and other illegal criminal activities are flooding the whole network space in different degrees, which may bring security threats and economic losses to enterprises and individuals at any time. And with the development of industrial informatization, the data in the process of industrial production needs to be shared or users can see the production data at any time, so the security of data in the transmission process becomes a problem. At present, the OPC UA protocol is used by the devices in the factory when they interact with each other. This paper mainly studies the security status and communication efficiency of OPC UA. The communication efficiency here is mainly the encryption efficiency of the encryption algorithm, which improves the communication efficiency by improving the encryption efficiency.","","978-1-7281-5224-0","10.1109/ICIBA50161.2020.9276932","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9276932","OPC UA;Hybrid encryption algorithm;Cyber Security;Communication efficiency","Security;Servers;Viruses (medical);Software;Computer viruses;Encryption;Trojan horses","computer network security;cryptographic protocols;Internet","communication efficiency;encryption efficiency;encryption algorithm;OPC UA security encryption method;continuous development;existing risk coefficient;original defense system;current risk;illegal network monitoring;network intrusion attack;network terrorism;illegal criminal activities;network space;security threats;economic losses;industrial informatization;industrial production needs;production data;transmission process;OPC UA protocol;security status","","","","7","IEEE","14 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the recent increase in connectivity has led to an extended attack vector. Therefore, it is important that CPS are secured against current and — due to their long life span — also against future threats, such as quantum computers. The security of present communication can be broken once a sufficiently powerful quantum computer is available. To protect against this attack vector, applications and protocols should start utilizing quantum-resistant primitives. One approach that maintains common security guarantees and protects against quantum computer attacks is to use hybrid constructions: a combination of classically secure and quantum-resistant schemes. In this work, we propose a hybrid key exchange mechanism for the industrial communication protocol Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA). We describe four distinct instantiations based on selected quantum-resistant key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs), namely NewHope, NTRU, CRYSTALS-Kyber, and Saber. We implement our resulting quantum-resistant modifications of OPC UA on two different ARM based platforms and present detailed performance footprints. Finally, we show the feasibility of employing hybrid quantum-resistant key exchange within OPC UA preserving industrial communication against future threats.","1946-0759","978-1-7281-8956-7","10.1109/ETFA46521.2020.9212112","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9212112","Industrial IoT;Hybrid key exchange;OPC UA;Post-quantum cryptography.","Computers;Performance evaluation;Encapsulation;Quantum computing;Protocols;Industrial communication;Solids","cryptographic protocols;Internet of Things;public key cryptography;quantum computing;quantum cryptography;telecommunication security","hybrid OPC UA;post-quantum security;cyber-physical systems;CPS;industrial environments;extended attack vector;future threats;quantum computers;quantum-resistant primitives;common security guarantees;quantum computer attacks;hybrid constructions;quantum-resistant schemes;hybrid key exchange mechanism;Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture;selected quantum-resistant key encapsulation mechanisms;hybrid quantum-resistant key exchange;ARM based platforms;quantum-resistant modifications;industrial communication protocol;industrial Internet of Things","","1","","32","IEEE","5 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Consequently, secure setups have to allow these devices to distinguish trustworthy and untrustworthy communication partners. One of the most significant and wide-spread protocols for Ethernet-based data exchange between industrial devices and controls is the Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA). Although the OPC UA standard includes certificate-based security measures, it lacks of applicable solutions for bootstrapping trust. For secure communication, each OPC UA application is supposed to hold an application certificate which can be managed by a Global Discovery Server (GDS). Simply put, applications request their certificate from the GDS as well as information about trustworthy and revoked certificates of third parties. However, the OPC UA specifications do not suggest a secure method to establish the initial trust for the communication between an application and the GDS. Moreover, in current implementations, the administrator has to manually interchange the certificates between the peers to build sufficient trust relationships. This paper proposes an evaluated portable trust-anchor-based concept to establish this initial trust and demonstrates it solely based on standardized OPC UA communication.","1946-0759","978-1-7281-8956-7","10.1109/ETFA46521.2020.9211904","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9211904","OPC UA;Security;Trust;Certificate;Provisioning;Trust Anchor;Global Discovery Server","Protocols;Conferences;Servers;Security;Standards;Manufacturing automation","computer network security;electronic data interchange;local area networks;protocols;trusted computing","secure communication;application certificate;Global Discovery Server;GDS;revoked certificates;OPC UA specifications;secure method;standardized OPC;portable trust-anchor-based concept;certificate-based security measures;OPC UA standard;Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture;Ethernet-based data exchange;untrustworthy communication partners;trustworthy communication partners;portable trust anchor","","2","","30","IEEE","5 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Built-in security mechanisms enable these protocols to protect communication and defend against network attacks. However, before IIoT devices can utilize these security mechanisms, they need to be securely onboarded in the network. Although several onboarding solutions exist, there is no widely applicable and easy solution for all protocols. Thus, owners of IIoT devices must currently perform multiple processes until they can securely use a device in operation, which requires a high amount of manual effort and onboarding infrastructure.In this work, we present a generic secure onboarding solution for a broad range of network protocols based on OPC UA. OPC UA is particularly suited for this task, as it is one of the most widespread IIoT protocols and one of few protocols whose standard defines a secure onboarding. Our solution leverages the OPC UA onboarding process to equip other IIoT protocols with the initial trust and credentials to establish secure connections. To this end, only minor extensions to the OPC UA implementation on devices are necessary, such that device owners can reuse their OPC UA onboarding infrastructure without any modifications. As a proof of concept for our solution, we demonstrate the secure onboarding of an HTTPS web server. Our implementation fully reuses the reference implementation OPC UA sample server as infrastructure and only needs minor extensions to the IIoT device.","","978-1-6654-9996-5","10.1109/ETFA52439.2022.9921547","Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9921547","OPC UA;secure onboarding;Industry 4.0","Performance evaluation;Protocols;Authentication;Web servers;Security;Task analysis;Standards","computer network security;hypermedia;Internet of Things;transport protocols","IIoT device;OPC UA;communication protocols;security mechanisms;onboarding solutions;widely applicable solution;onboarding infrastructure;generic secure onboarding solution;network protocols;IIoT protocols;secure connections;device owners;secure onboarding;protect communication;HTTPS Web server","","1","","12","IEEE","25 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Beginning from OPC UA v1.04, which was released in 2021, Pub/Sub mode has been supported in addition to Client/Server. Because it can easily support much more communications than usual, it can support all use cases in the industrial sector. An important property of OPC UA is encryption. It is effective in protecting communication data from tampering and eavesdropping but also makes it impossible to monitor communications. In ICS, ill commands to controllers can cause dangerous situations. Even a secure communication protocol cannot guarantee that the data being communicated are safe. There are many types of machines, such as operating support systems and engineering workstations, that can send commands to controllers. They are implemented in common operating systems and may fall victim to a cyber-attack. Therefore, the commands to controllers should be monitored.

Therefore, not only the need for standardized and manufacturer-agnostic control system communication protocols has grown, but also the requirement to protect those control systems' communication. There have already been numerous security analyses of different control system communication protocols; yet, these have not been combined with each other sufficiently, mainly due to three reasons: First, the life cycles of such protocols are usually much longer than those of other Internet and communication technologies, therefore legacy protocols are often not considered in current security analyses. Second, the usage of certain control system communication protocols is usually restricted to a particular infrastructure domain, which leads to an isolated view on them. Third, with the accelerating pace at which both control system communication protocols and threats against them develop, existing surveys are aging at an increased rate, making their re-investigation a necessity. In this paper, a comprehensive survey on the security of the most important control system communication protocols, namely Modbus, OPC UA, TASE.2, DNP3, IEC 60870-5-101, IEC 60870-5-104, and IEC 61850 is performed.

OPC UA is a standard that enables interoperable, secure, and reliable communication between industrial devices. To defend against cyber attacks, OPC UA has built-in security mechanisms that protect the authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of data in transit. Before communicating securely, it is essential that OPC UA devices are set up in a secure manner. This process is referred to as secure provisioning. An improper provisioning can lead to weak or insecure OPC UA deployments that enable adversaries to eavesdrop or even manipulate communication between industrial devices. Such insecure deployments can also be maliciously provoked by adversaries who tamper with insecure provisioning solutions. Despite secure provisioning is essential for OPC UA security and usability, there exists no overview and systematic analysis on the patchwork of different solutions in industry and academia. This article presents the first investigation of secure device provisioning solutions for the OPC UA communication protocol. First, desired objectives and evaluation criteria for secure provisioning of OPC UA devices are defined. Next, existing and emerging OPC UA provisioning solutions are analyzed and compared based on the elaborated objectives and criteria. Additionally, an outlook into the future of OPC UA provisioning is given, based on solutions from the IoT domain. Finally, the analyzed OPC UA secure provisioning solutions are compared, recommendations are given, and research gaps are identified. It is shown that contemporary provisioning solutions offer an insufficient level of security.

Since the introduction of industrial control systems in the 1970' s, industrial networks have been the target of malicious actors. More recently, the political and warfare-aspects of attacks on industrial and critical infrastructure are becoming more relevant. In contrast to classic home and office IT systems, industrial IT, so-called OT systems, have an effect on the physical world. Furthermore, industrial devices have long operation times, sometimes several decades. Updates and fixes are tedious and often not possible. The threats on industry with the legacy requirements of industrial environments creates the need for efficient intrusion detection that can be integrated into existing systems. In this work, the network data containing industrial operation is analysed with machine learning- and time series-based anomaly detection algorithms in order to discover the attacks introduced to the data. Two different data sets are used, one Modbus-based gas pipeline control traffic and one OPC UA-based batch processing traffic. In order to detect attacks, two machine learning-based algorithms are used, namely SVM and Random Forest. Both perform well, with Random Forest slightly outperforming SVM. Furthermore, extracting and selecting features as well as handling missing data is addressed in this work.","1847-358X","978-953-290-088-0","10.23919/SOFTCOM.2019.8903672","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8903672","Machine Learning;Artificial Intelligence;Cyber Security;IT Security;Industrial","","batch processing (industrial);computer network security;industrial control;learning (artificial intelligence);support vector machines;time series","physical world;operation times;industrial environments;network data;industrial operation;time series-based anomaly detection algorithms;Modbus-based gas pipeline control traffic;OPC UA-based batch processing traffic;machine learning-based algorithms;SVM;missing data;anomaly-based intrusion detection;industrial data;random forests;industrial enterprises;industrial control systems;industrial networks;malicious actors;political warfare-aspects;industrial infrastructure;critical infrastructure;OT systems","","39","","43","","21 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The introduction of the Internet of Things (IoT) in industrial processes represents a new revolution towards the Smart Manufacturing oncept and is usually designated as the 4th Industrial Revolution. Despite the huge interest from the industry to innovate their production systems, in order to increase revenues at lower costs, the IoT concept is still immature and fuzzy, which increases security related risks in industrial systems. Facing this paradigm and, since CPPS have reached a level of complexity, where the human intervention for operation and control is becoming increasingly difficult, Smart Factories require autonomic methodologies for security management and self-healing. This paper presents an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) approach for CPPS, based on the deterministic Dendritic Cell Algorithm (dDCA). To evaluate the dDCA effectiveness, a testing dataset was generated, by implementing and injecting various attacks on a OPC UA based CPPS testbed. The results show that these attacks can be successfully detected using the dDCA.","1946-0759","978-1-7281-8956-7","10.1109/ETFA46521.2020.9212021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9212021","CPPS;OPC UA;IDS;DCA;AIS;Network Attacks","Industries;Production systems;Costs;Security management;Intrusion detection;Fourth Industrial Revolution;Internet of Things","artificial immune systems;cyber-physical systems;Internet of Things;production engineering computing;security of data","attack detection;deterministic dendritic cell algorithm;CPPS;industrial growth;economic growth;industrial processes;industrial revolution;IoT concept;industrial systems;intrusion detection system;cyber-physical production systems;Internet of Things","","6","","39","IEEE","5 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a simple but strong security control solution, what we will call a logic application level security particularly for SCADA and DCS. This proposed method is based on message integrity and should not be viewed as the main, nor the only level of protection that an industrial automation system is expected to have, but can be a low-level security procedure that avoids intelligent attacks such as Stuxnet.","2157-4960","978-1-7281-1542-9","10.1109/NTMS.2019.8763839","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8763839","Stuxnet;Obfuscation;Encryption;MAC;SCADA;DCS","Security;Computer worms;IEC Standards;Integrated circuits;Automation","critical infrastructures;distributed control;field programmable gate arrays;IEC standards;industrial control;programmable controllers;SCADA systems","authentication layer;IEC 61113-3 applications;Stuxnet ICS attack;Siemens automation products;ICS security;automation products suppliers;OPC Foundation;industrial automation applications;logic application level security;industrial automation system;low-level security procedure;intelligent attacks;security control solution;message integrity;OPC-UA design;SCADA;distributed control systems;DCS","","","","27","IEEE","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The solution supported by standards, such as, OPC-UA, is to sign or encrypt messages. However, given the limited resources of devices, instead of encrypting all messages in the network, it is better to encrypt only the messages that if tampered with or injected, could lead to undesired configurations. This paper describes the use of formal verification to analyse the security of I4.0 applications. We formalize in Rewriting Logic, I4.0 applications and systems, i.e., networked sets of devices, and a symbolic intruder model. Our formalization can be executed by the tool Maude to automate such security analysis, e.g., determine which messages are sufficient to sign in order avoid injection and tampering attacks.","1946-0759","978-1-7281-0303-7","10.1109/ETFA.2019.8869428","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8869428","","Cryptography;Grippers;Production facilities;Tools;Industries;Standards","cryptography;formal verification;rewriting systems","formal security verification;Industry 4.0 applications;counter-measures;cyber-attacks;catastrophic events;tampering attacks;system connectivity;OPC-UA;security analysis;Rewriting Logic","","8","","15","IEEE","17 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the production network, these industrial systems communicate with each other by exchanging data packets. Due to this shift, the traditional industrial systems which were not connected to the Internet are now transformed into `smart factories', where these systems are able to communicate via the Internet. However, making the industrial system online also imposes threats of being attacked by malware and viruses. Industrial automation needs security measures, such as Intrusion Detection System (IDS), to analyze the data packets in order to protect the industrial systems and production network from these threats. These data packets contain headers of industrial protocols, such as Modbus and Profinet. Present approaches such as hand-written parsers face some challenges to parse these packets. Therefore, this paper sheds some light on some of these approaches to be able to make parser development simple, fast, and easy to maintain considering especially the industrial protocols. Parsers for several protocols such as Modbus, Profinet, OPC UA, and S7comm have been developed and evaluated. Evaluation of the implementation shows that these protocols can be parsed correctly and efficiently. This output of this parser is being used as inputs of an Industrial IDS system.","","978-1-5386-1150-0","10.1109/ICCITECHN.2017.8281842","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8281842","","Production;Industries;Routing protocols;Information technology;Domain specific languages;Automation","factory automation;grammars;Internet;Internet of Things;invasive software;production engineering computing;specification languages","industrial system;production network;industrial protocols;Industrial IDS system;industrial automation;Distributed Control Systems;domain specific languages;packet parsers;Internet of Things;smart factories;data packet analysis;malware;production industries","","3","","24","EU","8 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These systems can rarely be designed to do all three, forcing engineers to make tradeoffs based on the mission parameters - i.e. should the robotic appendage have a claw, drill, or shovel, and which would be best suited for the mission? Additionally, as more industrial and government entities partake in space exploration, data protection is needed. To address these challenges, we present a first-of-its-kind robotic linkage that has no wiring between the joints. Instead, quasi-wireless capacitive power transfer is used to send energy over the robot’s chassis without a return wire. This enables the system to be completely modular through the use of single-contact permanent magnet connections, allowing rapid alterations in joint kinematics and/or the changing of end effectors.For collecting sensor data from the robotic arm and to send remote commands to it, we use a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. Data transmission relies on MQTT and OPC UA communication protocols with encryption. The SCADA server logs and archives sensor data and provides the functionality for authorized users to send remote commands from SCADA client(s) to motors. A SCADA client can be any of the web browsers that connect to a server via a secure communication channel using SSL protocol. Furthermore, as an extra data protection mechanism, we inject noise to the sensor data traffic, which obfuscates the timing of sensor data packets and adds confusion about which data packet represents which motor.","2380-7636","978-1-6654-0371-9","10.1109/WiSEE50203.2021.9613841","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9613841","wireless sensor networks;IoT security;space cybersecurity;SCADA systems","Wireless sensor networks;Protocols;Service robots;SCADA systems;Robot sensing systems;Permanent magnet motors;End effectors","aerospace robotics;control engineering computing;cryptographic protocols;data acquisition;inductive power transmission;manipulators;queueing theory;space communication links;telecommunication security;telerobotics;transport protocols","quasiwireless capacitive power transfer;secure Data Acquisition;robotic systems;space infrastructure;space exploration;end effectors;probe surfaces;mission parameters - i.e;robotic appendage;industrial government entities partake;first-of-its-kind robotic linkage;robot;return wire;single-contact permanent magnet connections;robotic arm;remote commands;Data Acquisition system;Data transmission;archives;SCADA client;secure communication channel;extra data protection mechanism;sensor data traffic;sensor data packets;data packet","","","","20","IEEE","22 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper addresses this problem by identifying the reasons why so few countermeasures exist and what approaches could be taken to remedy this in a manner that serves both traditional Industrial Control Systems (ICSs), and the emerging needs of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT).Circa two-thousand-five-hundred documents (sourced from a combination of five academic search engines, standards agencies, and industrial reports) were reviewed and analysed. From this was found that existing ICS countermeasures are largely derived from existing IT solutions that do not seek to take advantage of the specific characteristics of ICSs – making them less effective or inappropriate in many ICS applications; this is particularly true of network intrusion protection systems, for which false positive detection can have a serious impact on the safe and reliable operation of industrial facilities.It is proposed that the characteristics of ICS and IIoT communications networks lend themselves to a whitelisting approach to network intrusion protection, which would avoid the problem of false positives, and that future work based on the OPC-UA protocol would prove this and demonstrate its suitability for all ICS and IIoT applications.","","978-1-6654-5200-7","10.1109/Control55989.2022.9781374","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9781374","","Integrated circuits;Protocols;Industrial control;Search engines;Safety;Security;Reliability","computer network security;industrial control;Internet of Things;search engines","security problem;IIoT;academic search engines;industrial reports;ICS applications;network intrusion protection systems;safe operation;industrial facilities;Industrial Control system networks;enhance intrusion prevention;Industrial control system security;industrial output;Critical National Infrastructure;cyber-attack","","1","","41","IEEE","27 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
