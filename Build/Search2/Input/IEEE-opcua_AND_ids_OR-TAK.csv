The introduction of the Internet of Things (IoT) in industrial processes represents a new revolution towards the Smart Manufacturing oncept and is usually designated as the 4th Industrial Revolution. Despite the huge interest from the industry to innovate their production systems, in order to increase revenues at lower costs, the IoT concept is still immature and fuzzy, which increases security related risks in industrial systems. Facing this paradigm and, since CPPS have reached a level of complexity, where the human intervention for operation and control is becoming increasingly difficult, Smart Factories require autonomic methodologies for security management and self-healing. This paper presents an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) approach for CPPS, based on the deterministic Dendritic Cell Algorithm (dDCA). To evaluate the dDCA effectiveness, a testing dataset was generated, by implementing and injecting various attacks on a OPC UA based CPPS testbed. The results show that these attacks can be successfully detected using the dDCA.","1946-0759","978-1-7281-8956-7","10.1109/ETFA46521.2020.9212021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9212021","CPPS;OPC UA;IDS;DCA;AIS;Network Attacks","Industries;Production systems;Costs;Security management;Intrusion detection;Fourth Industrial Revolution;Internet of Things","artificial immune systems;cyber-physical systems;Internet of Things;production engineering computing;security of data","attack detection;deterministic dendritic cell algorithm;CPPS;industrial growth;economic growth;industrial processes;industrial revolution;IoT concept;industrial systems;intrusion detection system;cyber-physical production systems;Internet of Things","","5","","39","IEEE","5 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

OPC UA is a communication protocol that bridges data exchange between devices using different communication platforms and protocols. OPC UA can also connect devices between levels in automation pyramids. As an open platform, open-source OPC UAs such as open62541, OpenOPCUA, and FreeOpcUa is currently being developed by several developer communities. Implementing open-source OPC UA is an attractive option if cost is a significant consideration. However, the primary purpose of implementing OPC UA is to communicate or exchange information effectively and reliably; information about the characteristics and performance of open-source OPC is needed before designing a particular open-source OPC-based automation system platform. This paper utilized FreeOpcUa, a Python OPC UA library, to determine communication traffic features between client and server and perform anomaly detection on the traffic. The results showed that when all clients read server data simultaneously, there was duplication (up to 9%) and loss (up to 5%) of some data packets. Otherwise, the server could read all clients’ transmitted data. Anomaly detection testing with an image-encoding CNN also showed promising results, with accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score values approaching one.","","978-1-6654-0942-1","10.1109/ICEVT55516.2022.9925002","Kementerian Pendidikan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9925002","OPC UA;client-server;network traffic;characteristic;anomaly;image-encoding;CNN","Vehicular and wireless technologies;Automation;Protocols;Scalability;Reliability engineering;Libraries;Servers","client-server systems;convolutional neural nets;data communication;electronic data interchange;image coding;industrial control;protocols;telecommunication traffic","open source OPC UA data traffic characteristic;convolutional neural network;communication protocol;data exchange;Python OPC UA library;communication traffic features;anomaly detection testing;open-source OPC-based automation system;IT technology;OT technology;automation pyramids;FreeOpcUa;image encoding CNN;F-score values;open platform communication unified architecture;operational technology","","","","32","IEEE","25 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since the introduction of industrial control systems in the 1970' s, industrial networks have been the target of malicious actors. More recently, the political and warfare-aspects of attacks on industrial and critical infrastructure are becoming more relevant. In contrast to classic home and office IT systems, industrial IT, so-called OT systems, have an effect on the physical world. Furthermore, industrial devices have long operation times, sometimes several decades. Updates and fixes are tedious and often not possible. The threats on industry with the legacy requirements of industrial environments creates the need for efficient intrusion detection that can be integrated into existing systems. In this work, the network data containing industrial operation is analysed with machine learning- and time series-based anomaly detection algorithms in order to discover the attacks introduced to the data. Two different data sets are used, one Modbus-based gas pipeline control traffic and one OPC UA-based batch processing traffic. In order to detect attacks, two machine learning-based algorithms are used, namely SVM and Random Forest. Both perform well, with Random Forest slightly outperforming SVM. Furthermore, extracting and selecting features as well as handling missing data is addressed in this work.","1847-358X","978-953-290-088-0","10.23919/SOFTCOM.2019.8903672","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8903672","Machine Learning;Artificial Intelligence;Cyber Security;IT Security;Industrial","","batch processing (industrial);computer network security;industrial control;learning (artificial intelligence);support vector machines;time series","physical world;operation times;industrial environments;network data;industrial operation;time series-based anomaly detection algorithms;Modbus-based gas pipeline control traffic;OPC UA-based batch processing traffic;machine learning-based algorithms;SVM;missing data;anomaly-based intrusion detection;industrial data;random forests;industrial enterprises;industrial control systems;industrial networks;malicious actors;political warfare-aspects;industrial infrastructure;critical infrastructure;OT systems","","37","","43","","21 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

OPC UA is widely recognized as one of the effective technologies to address such an issue. Traditional ways of constructing OPC UA information model need to manually add and define different nodes describing the devices and their attributes (e.g., names, ID, data types, etc.), which is costly and time-consuming when a huge number of devices is involved. Some works defined mapping rules between existing data model/structure/exchange format and OPC UA information model to reduce the workloads. However, they ignored the construction process of OPC UA information model and assumed that the existing referenced data structure/exchange format was created before the transformation of information model. Also, the mapping rules do not provide detailed implementation of mapping method. In this paper, we take the first attempt on the fast construction process of OPC UA information model. The raw data of field devices represented as structured data in rational database is fully utilized to extract the information, even though there are no existing data model for reference. The challenge of transforming structured data in database to OPC UA address space is discussed, based on which we propose a specific fast construction method for OPC UA information model. The method is deployed in the built industrial discrete manufacturing production line platform to evaluate the applicability of fast information model construction.","","978-1-6654-2755-5","10.1109/ICITES53477.2021.9637064","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1702100,2018YFE0126300); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1909207); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637064","Automated Modeling;OPC UA;Information Model;Relational Database","Performance evaluation;OWL;XML;Relational databases;Data models;Real-time systems;Production facilities","data models;data structures;open systems;production engineering computing;relational databases","data model;structured data;OPC UA information model;fast information model construction;relational database;manufacturing factory;production lines;performance monitoring;interconnectivity;interoperability","","","","12","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper addresses this problem by identifying the reasons why so few countermeasures exist and what approaches could be taken to remedy this in a manner that serves both traditional Industrial Control Systems (ICSs), and the emerging needs of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT).Circa two-thousand-five-hundred documents (sourced from a combination of five academic search engines, standards agencies, and industrial reports) were reviewed and analysed. From this was found that existing ICS countermeasures are largely derived from existing IT solutions that do not seek to take advantage of the specific characteristics of ICSs – making them less effective or inappropriate in many ICS applications; this is particularly true of network intrusion protection systems, for which false positive detection can have a serious impact on the safe and reliable operation of industrial facilities.It is proposed that the characteristics of ICS and IIoT communications networks lend themselves to a whitelisting approach to network intrusion protection, which would avoid the problem of false positives, and that future work based on the OPC-UA protocol would prove this and demonstrate its suitability for all ICS and IIoT applications.","","978-1-6654-5200-7","10.1109/Control55989.2022.9781374","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9781374","","Integrated circuits;Protocols;Industrial control;Search engines;Safety;Security;Reliability","computer network security;industrial control;Internet of Things;search engines","security problem;IIoT;academic search engines;industrial reports;ICS applications;network intrusion protection systems;safe operation;industrial facilities;Industrial Control system networks;enhance intrusion prevention;Industrial control system security;industrial output;Critical National Infrastructure;cyber-attack","","","","41","IEEE","27 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A mixed production line setup poses several challenges and properties that make using anomaly detection more complex compared to monotonous production processes. We consider a high variation in the produced products, diluted temporal dependencies, imbalance in the frequency of product types and sensor measurements differing based on the produced product type. We gather contextual information using the OPC UA standard and extract information such as running program name. In this work we adapt and evaluate common anomaly detection methods to such a scenario. By building ensembles of anomaly detectors, we account for different setups. Each single work-piece gets evaluated for anomalous behaviour. We evaluate the anomaly detection by using data from a mixed production setup in the automotive domain. The context based approach is compared to a sliding window approach, which we use as a baseline. The results highlight that our product type-based approach shows a higher precision and recall for all applied detection techniques, by utilizing contextual information. Our experiments additionally show that in the selected industrial case study our approach achieves good results even when only limited data per product type is available.","","978-1-6654-0424-2","10.1109/PerComWorkshops51409.2021.9430995","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9430995","data mining;real-time system;maintenance prediction;adaptive network;reliability evaluation;sustainability","Pervasive computing;Conferences;Production;Prediction methods;Detectors;Maintenance engineering;Frequency measurement","data mining;production engineering computing;production management;real-time systems;security of data;user interfaces","information extraction;OPC UA standard;product type-based approach;mixed production setup;anomaly detection methods;produced product type;monotonous production processes;mixed production line setup","","","","28","IEEE","24 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the production network, these industrial systems communicate with each other by exchanging data packets. Due to this shift, the traditional industrial systems which were not connected to the Internet are now transformed into `smart factories', where these systems are able to communicate via the Internet. However, making the industrial system online also imposes threats of being attacked by malware and viruses. Industrial automation needs security measures, such as Intrusion Detection System (IDS), to analyze the data packets in order to protect the industrial systems and production network from these threats. These data packets contain headers of industrial protocols, such as Modbus and Profinet. Present approaches such as hand-written parsers face some challenges to parse these packets. Therefore, this paper sheds some light on some of these approaches to be able to make parser development simple, fast, and easy to maintain considering especially the industrial protocols. Parsers for several protocols such as Modbus, Profinet, OPC UA, and S7comm have been developed and evaluated. Evaluation of the implementation shows that these protocols can be parsed correctly and efficiently. This output of this parser is being used as inputs of an Industrial IDS system.","","978-1-5386-1150-0","10.1109/ICCITECHN.2017.8281842","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8281842","","Production;Industries;Routing protocols;Information technology;Domain specific languages;Automation","factory automation;grammars;Internet;Internet of Things;invasive software;production engineering computing;specification languages","industrial system;production network;industrial protocols;Industrial IDS system;industrial automation;Distributed Control Systems;domain specific languages;packet parsers;Internet of Things;smart factories;data packet analysis;malware;production industries","","3","","24","EU","8 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
