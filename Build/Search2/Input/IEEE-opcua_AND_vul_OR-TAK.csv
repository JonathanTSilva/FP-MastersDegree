This paper clarifies how this model leaves OPC UA Servers vulnerable to request overload. A solution based on rate throttling is demonstrated to counter this vulnerability. The requirements of the resulting service are quantified and an open-source prototypical implementation is built using the Apache ZooKeeper and open 62541 libraries.","","978-1-5090-5949-2","10.1109/ICIT.2018.8352430","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8352430","","Uninterruptible power systems","application program interfaces;client-server systems;open systems;security of data","open-source prototypical implementation;open 62541 libraries;throttled service calls;Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture standard;client-server architecture;request overload;rate throttling;push-based communication model;OPC UA Servers;Apache ZooKeeper","","2","","16","IEEE","30 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This monitor is able to identify different network protocols automatically in single or multiple network protocols, maintain surveillance over network status in real-time according to the security configuration strategy, supervise illegal access from unauthorized devices, abnormal message, network abnormalities, etc., track the equipment critical process data, and realize local and remote alarm function. After testing, this monitor does not affect the original industrial control network and can effectively protect the security of industrial control network.","","978-1-7281-9004-4","10.1109/ICPECA51329.2021.9362589","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9362589","OPC UA;Modbus TCP;Profinet;security monitor","Protocols;Industrial control;Ethernet;Security;Personnel;Monitoring;Testing","computer network security;control engineering computing;industrial control;local area networks;transport protocols","industrial network integration requirements;security strategy;security function;mainstream industrial ethernet;protocol deep analysis;multiprotocol industry;single network protocols;multiple network protocols;network status;security configuration strategy;network abnormalities;original industrial control network;multiprotocol industrial ethernet security monitor;information security;industrial communication network","","","","10","IEEE","1 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, not only the need for standardized and manufacturer-agnostic control system communication protocols has grown, but also the requirement to protect those control systems' communication. There have already been numerous security analyses of different control system communication protocols; yet, these have not been combined with each other sufficiently, mainly due to three reasons: First, the life cycles of such protocols are usually much longer than those of other Internet and communication technologies, therefore legacy protocols are often not considered in current security analyses. Second, the usage of certain control system communication protocols is usually restricted to a particular infrastructure domain, which leads to an isolated view on them. Third, with the accelerating pace at which both control system communication protocols and threats against them develop, existing surveys are aging at an increased rate, making their re-investigation a necessity. In this paper, a comprehensive survey on the security of the most important control system communication protocols, namely Modbus, OPC UA, TASE.2, DNP3, IEC 60870-5-101, IEC 60870-5-104, and IEC 61850 is performed. To achieve comparability, a common test methodology based on attacks exploiting well-known control system protocol vulnerabilities is created for all protocols. In addition, the effectiveness of the related security standard IEC 62351 is analyzed by a pre- and post-IEC 62351 comparison.","1553-877X","","10.1109/COMST.2018.2872114","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8472799","Control systems;network protocols;network security","Protocols;Security;IEC Standards;SCADA systems;Tutorials","control system security;IEC standards;protocols;telecommunication security","manufacturer-agnostic control system communication protocols;communication technologies;legacy protocols;related security standard IEC 62351;control network protocols;security analysis;security challenges;critical infrastructures;potential attack surface;control system communication protocols;control system protocol vulnerabilities;Modbus;OPC UA;TASE.2;DNP3;IEC 60870-5-101;IEC 60870-5-104;IEC 61850","","59","","74","IEEE","26 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
