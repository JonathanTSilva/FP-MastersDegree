This use case not only requires the technical base to determine how and what information has to be exchanged during the startup of software and hardware components in the production environment, but also deals with very sensitive information which results in a high demand to secure these. In consequence, plug-and-work mechanisms which base on industrial standards such as AutomationML (IEC 62714) which defines what will be transferred and OPC UA (IEC 62541) which defines how to communicate must be embedded in a confidential environment to secure confidential information meeting the demands of the end user, e.g. plant operators. To this end, the combination of both, OPC UA and AutomationML, must face security issues. A role-based security concept based on both standards and implemented in a software tool is discussed in the present paper.","1946-0759","978-1-4673-7929-8","10.1109/ETFA.2015.7301640","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7301640","communication;security;AutomationML;OPC UA","Servers;Access control;Permission;Standards;Production;Load modeling","IEC standards;security of data;XML","OPC UA;AutomationML;secure plug-and-work mechanisms;IEC 62714;IEC 62541;role-based security concept;software tool","","16","","20","IEEE","26 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To solve these problems or optimize the functions, an intelligent substation auxiliary control system is proposed. The system innovatively applies OPC UA to the construction of the auxiliary control system. First, through the use of OPC UA's unique object-oriented modeling method as well as the joint specification modeling of OPC UA and IEC61850, to solve the data communication problems caused by heterogeneous devices. Second, applying the Client/Server mode to realize the remote access from authorized mobile clients and give instructions, to cope with abnormal conditions, which reduces the dependency on people. Clients of other authorized enterprises are allowed to access the working data of the devices they are interested in, makes full use of massive data and ensures the information security of the system. Third, Pub/Sub mode is applied to enable the underlying devices to communicate directly with each other through the middleware, which reduces the response time of equipment joint debugging and improve the real-time performance. In addition, through OPC UA, the industrial data of the system can be transmitted over the Internet, realizing the combination of the Internet of Things and the Internet, which is an idea of the combination of the two in the future.","2771-7011","978-1-6654-8206-6","10.1109/REPE55559.2022.9949983","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9949983","auxiliary control system;Client/Server;information security;information modeling;OPC UA","Performance evaluation;Renewable energy sources;Power engineering;Substations;Object oriented modeling;Control systems;Real-time systems","client-server systems;control engineering computing;formal specification;Internet of Things;middleware;mobile computing;object-oriented methods;power engineering computing;power generation control;power system measurement;real-time systems;smart power grids;substation automation","abnormal response;authorized mobile clients;data communication;data communication problems;different underlying devices;heterogeneous devices;IEC61850;information security;intelligent substation auxiliary control system;joint specification modeling;massive data;middleware;OPC UA unique object-oriented modeling method;power grid monitoring;response time;security mechanism;smart grid;substation intelligent auxiliary control system;traditional substation auxiliary control system;working data","","","","13","IEEE","21 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Beginning from OPC UA v1.04, which was released in 2021, Pub/Sub mode has been supported in addition to Client/Server. Because it can easily support much more communications than usual, it can support all use cases in the industrial sector. An important property of OPC UA is encryption. It is effective in protecting communication data from tampering and eavesdropping but also makes it impossible to monitor communications. In ICS, ill commands to controllers can cause dangerous situations. Even a secure communication protocol cannot guarantee that the data being communicated are safe. There are many types of machines, such as operating support systems and engineering workstations, that can send commands to controllers. They are implemented in common operating systems and may fall victim to a cyber-attack. Therefore, the commands to controllers should be monitored.

OPC UA is a standard that enables interoperable, secure, and reliable communication between industrial devices. To defend against cyber attacks, OPC UA has built-in security mechanisms that protect the authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of data in transit. Before communicating securely, it is essential that OPC UA devices are set up in a secure manner. This process is referred to as secure provisioning. An improper provisioning can lead to weak or insecure OPC UA deployments that enable adversaries to eavesdrop or even manipulate communication between industrial devices. Such insecure deployments can also be maliciously provoked by adversaries who tamper with insecure provisioning solutions. Despite secure provisioning is essential for OPC UA security and usability, there exists no overview and systematic analysis on the patchwork of different solutions in industry and academia. This article presents the first investigation of secure device provisioning solutions for the OPC UA communication protocol. First, desired objectives and evaluation criteria for secure provisioning of OPC UA devices are defined. Next, existing and emerging OPC UA provisioning solutions are analyzed and compared based on the elaborated objectives and criteria. Additionally, an outlook into the future of OPC UA provisioning is given, based on solutions from the IoT domain. Finally, the analyzed OPC UA secure provisioning solutions are compared, recommendations are given, and research gaps are identified. It is shown that contemporary provisioning solutions offer an insufficient level of security. Emerging and future solutions provide much higher security guarantees but impose a tradeoff between usability and requirements on devices and infrastructures.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3096062","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research in the scope of the Basissystem Industrie 4.0 (BaSys) 4.2 Project(grant numbers:01IS19022B); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9478911","Communication system security;device provisioning;Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT);industry 40;network security;OPC UA;secure provisioning","Security;Servers;Standards;Industrial Internet of Things;Usability;Industries","","","","7","","39","CCBYNCND","9 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For secure communication, each OPC UA application is supposed to hold an application certificate which can be managed by a Global Discovery Server (GDS). Simply put, applications request their certificate from the GDS as well as information about trustworthy and revoked certificates of third parties. However, the OPC UA specifications do not suggest a secure method to establish the initial trust for the communication between an application and the GDS. Moreover, in current implementations, the administrator has to manually interchange the certificates between the peers to build sufficient trust relationships. This paper proposes an evaluated portable trust-anchor-based concept to establish this initial trust and demonstrates it solely based on standardized OPC UA communication.","1946-0759","978-1-7281-8956-7","10.1109/ETFA46521.2020.9211904","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9211904","OPC UA;Security;Trust;Certificate;Provisioning;Trust Anchor;Global Discovery Server","Protocols;Conferences;Servers;Security;Standards;Manufacturing automation","computer network security;electronic data interchange;local area networks;protocols;trusted computing","secure communication;application certificate;Global Discovery Server;GDS;revoked certificates;OPC UA specifications;secure method;standardized OPC;portable trust-anchor-based concept;certificate-based security measures;OPC UA standard;Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture;Ethernet-based data exchange;untrustworthy communication partners;trustworthy communication partners;portable trust anchor","","2","","30","IEEE","5 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Industry 4.0 consists of various technical components such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), IoT, OPC UA, and cloud. There could be cyber risks when these technical components are used in Industrial Control System (ICS) without security consideration. Therefore cyber risk assessment, reconsideration of implementation, operation are necessary to adopt Industry 4.0. Problems of previous research for ICS risk assessments are some of them are theoretical and conceptual methods such as simulations. Moreover, they do not focus on Industry 4.0 components.The objective of this research is to prove the concrete cyber risks and introduces corresponding secure implementations for Industry 4.0 components such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA). The proposed method has benefits for clarifying impacts on the real world by cyber-attacks through penetration tests against ICS testbed with actual machines.","","978-1-6654-3156-9","10.1109/COINS51742.2021.9524088","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9524088","Industry 4.0;Industrial Control System;cyber security;ICS testbed;AI;cloud;IoT;OPC UA","Industries;Cloud computing;Power measurement;Industrial control;Control systems;Security;Risk management","artificial intelligence;cloud computing;electronic data interchange;industrial control;Internet of Things;production engineering computing;risk management;security of data;service-oriented architecture","cyber risk assessment;ICS risk assessments;artificial intelligence;cyber-attacks;cyber security risks;automation data exchange;industrial control system;Industry 4.0;OPC UA;Internet of Things;cloud technologies;OPC Unified Architecture","","","","24","IEEE","2 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
