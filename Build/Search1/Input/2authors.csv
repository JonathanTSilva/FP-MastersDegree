The engineered kinematics of virtual models must dynamically behave like physical elements. This paper proposes an algorithm and implements the software tool for the automatic generation of OPC UA connections between the IEC 61499-based control application and the OPC UA server.

OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) provides an extensible information model but lacks formal semantics. Ontologies based on the Web Ontology Language (OWL) can provide such formal semantics. Thus, we present a transformation approach that converts OPC UA information models (or only parts of them) into domain-specific ontologies. The transformation process consists of two steps. The first step is a mapping from OPC UA to OWL Full. The second step performs a graph transformation, based on SPARQL rules, into the domain-specified target ontology. The adaption of this transformation to the source information model and the target ontology can be accomplished by only adapting these transformation rules. The presented approach is evaluated for a use case of an industrial heating process to show its flexibility.","","978-1-7281-6207-2","10.1109/ICPS49255.2021.9468254","TU; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9468254","information modeling;ontology;model transformation;OPC UA","Heating systems;Adaptation models;Conferences;Semantics;OWL;Ontologies;Cyber-physical systems","knowledge representation languages;ontologies (artificial intelligence);open systems","domain-specified target ontology;source information model;transformation rules;OPC UA information models;domain-specific ontologies;semantics interoperability;cyber-physical systems;complex data processing;facilitating interworking;OPC Unified Architecture;extensible information model;formal semantics;Web Ontology Language;transformation approach;transformation process;graph transformation","","","","21","IEEE","5 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To allow easy communication with other actors programmed in different languages on the factory floor, the MPP utilizes the well-known OPC UA, the communication standard defined by the Reference Architectural Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0).","","978-1-7281-2977-8","10.1109/ICII.2019.00061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9065072","OPC-UA;Mobile-robot;IEC-61499;ROS;Factory-of-the-Future;Rapid;Interoperability;Industry-4.0","Production facilities;Automation;IEC Standards;Service robots;Conferences","agile manufacturing;control engineering computing;formal specification;IEC standards;industrial control;industrial robots;mobile robots;object-oriented languages;open systems;production engineering computing","Robot Operating System;ABB's Rapid language;factory floor;communication standard;agile factory;Reference Architectural Model Industrie 4.0;collaborative interoperable mobile production platform;graphical IEC 61499 language;specification standards;production space;MPP;ABB IRB14000 YuMI precision robot;lifting capability;mobile robot","","1","","15","IEEE","19 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An essential part of smart manufacturing are production facilities that dynamically adapt to changing production needs. This brings completely new challenges to functional safety systems, which are mandatory for the protection of man, machine, and environment. Currently, functional safety systems are designed and certified in a static way. The safety design and the configuration are derived from the risk assessment which is performed during the design of a machine. Once the system is put into operation, the safety configuration is not changed anymore. This approach constitutes an impediment to flexibility which smart manufacturing production facilities require nowadays.This paper proposes the design of a self-organizing safety system with the objective to assist an engineer who operates a smart manufacturing facility by discovering all safety-related devices and generating automatically a suitable safety configuration. This configuration will be deployed to the system automatically after adaptation and validation by the safety engineer. The proposed self-organizing safety system, simplifies the safety configuration in a dynamically changing environment. Consequently, it would reduce engineering efforts and decrease machine downtime which improves profitability.","1946-0759","978-1-7281-8956-7","10.1109/ETFA46521.2020.9211905","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9211905","Smart Manufacturing;Industry 4.0;Functional Safety;Interoperability;Flexibility;Real-Time;Unified Communication;OPC UA;TSN","Profitability;Conferences;Production facilities;Safety;Fourth Industrial Revolution;Risk management;Manufacturing automation","accident prevention;health and safety;intelligent manufacturing systems;production engineering computing;production facilities;risk management;safety systems","self-organizing safety system;Industry 4.0;safety configuration;smart manufacturing facility;safety design;functional safety systems;production facilities;flexible safety systems;dynamically changing environment;safety system;safety-related devices","","13","","14","IEEE","5 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They are a holistic application where current and future plant information is available for operation support of process plants. Existing tracking simulators have focused on the application of online and offline methods for estimation of their underlying first principle models (FPMs). However, these systems have been less attractive than similar alternatives based on empirical modeling, due to the lack of systematic approaches that address challenges across the tracking simulation lifecycle, such as laborious development of FPMs and high integration costs with the process or with other systems and simulation methods. In contrast, the approach presented in this paper integrates a tracking simulation architecture and various simulation methods to address the described challenges as follows. In order to tackle timeconsuming development of FPMs, a method for generating tracking simulation models from models created during design phase is proposed. The process of connecting the tracking simulator to the physical plant and initializing the tracking simulator is automated. An optimization method for tracking simulation applications is developed to overcome drawbacks of available methods. The simulation architecture developed applies the proposed methodology during the various phases of tracking simulation. Furthermore, it exploits industrial communication standards to avoid the need for point-to-point integration of various simulators and other systems used over the course of the tracking simulator lifecycle. The work is demonstrated with laboratory process equipment.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2811845","Engineering Rulez Research Project through Tekes, Technical Research Centre of Finland, Aalto University, Equa, Fennovoima, Fortum, Masinotek, Outotec, Prosys OPC, PSK, Pöyry, and Semantum; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8306506","Online simulation;OPC UA;process simulation;tracking simulation;simulation architecture","Adaptation models;Estimation;Predictive models;Process control;Monitoring;Target tracking;Optimization methods","decision support systems;digital simulation;optimisation;product life cycle management;production engineering computing","online first principle simulation model;tracking simulation models;tracking simulator lifecycle;lifecycle-wide tracking simulation architecture;decision support application;process plants operation support;optimization method;industrial communication standards;process simulation;process plant lifecycle","","14","","60","OAPA","5 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Middlewares and gateways could provide a possible solution to bridge this OT/IT gap. In this context, this paper examines the feasibility of interconnecting legacy OT protocols via different middlewares and gateways by presenting two simplified scenarios. Each scenario exemplifies a possible use-case by either mimicking bidirectional tunnelling or propagating (mirroring) of automation data. Both scenarios use OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) and Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) and a respective gateway prototype. The paper concludes by outlining future research challenges by discussing the limitations of the selected scenarios related to configuration, deployment and scalability.","","978-1-7281-5730-6","10.1109/ICIT46573.2021.9453658","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9453658","Industrial communication;Industrial Internet of Things;middleware;gateway","Protocols;Automation;Runtime;Scalability;Prototypes;Logic gates;Tunneling","internetworking;IP networks;middleware;queueing theory;telemetry;transport protocols","Operational Technology communication protocols;Information Technology;legacy OT;automation data;gateway prototype;IP-based middlewares;runtime information;OPC UA;message queuing telemetry transport;MQTT;OT-IT gap;operational technology data;bidirectional tunnelling","","2","","30","IEEE","18 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A problem that often occurs in retrofitting scenarios, in which simulation models and control systems are partly already in place, is that the interfaces of the simulation models and the automation system are not interoperable. Modifying the interfaces prolongs development time and possibly introduces errors. This paper presents a method that attempts to solve this issue by semi-automatically connecting the interfaces to establish data flow between these systems. A proof of concept implementation is developed along a use case of a thermal-hydraulic system to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed approach. Therefore, the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) and OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) are used, as they are widely accepted standards for simulation and machine-to-machine communication in the industrial domain.","","978-1-6654-9770-1","10.1109/ICPS51978.2022.9816912","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9816912","System Simulations;Automation;Cyber-Physical Systems","Machine-to-machine communications;Conferences;Cyber-physical systems;Control systems;Fourth Industrial Revolution;Standards;Context modeling","control engineering computing;cyber-physical systems;machine-to-machine communication;open systems;production engineering computing;user interfaces","simulation models;control systems;automation system;thermal-hydraulic system;functional mock-up interface;commissioning phase;cyber-physical systems;seamlessly interfacing automation systems;OPC unified architecture;machine-to-machine communication;Industry 4.0;retrofitting scenario","","1","","15","IEEE","18 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
