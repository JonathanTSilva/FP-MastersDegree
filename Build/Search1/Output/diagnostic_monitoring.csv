4,Controlling CAN Servo Step Drives and Their Remote Monitoring by Using Protocol OPC UA,"The diverse requirements of customers in automation systems increase the need for improved adaptability, flexibility and of simplicity production processes. which creates new horizons for modern production systems. Fortunately, the achievements of the Industry 4.0 (fourth industrial revolution) have provided many solutions to these problems. In this study, an OPC UA-based solution is proposed for monitoring the working process of CAN servo drives. By integrating C++ based OPC UA libraries to implement common OPC UA functionality and developing protocol of interaction between the kernel of CNC system and OPC UA server. The aim of this work is to ensure the connection mechanism between OPC UA Server of CNC system and OPC UA clients which are currently existed on the market. This flexible model allows users to remotely tune and set up CAN servo drives and monitor their work."
11,From Requirement Specification to OPC UA Information Model Design: A Product Assembly Line Monitoring Case Study,"Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture (OPC UA) has emerged as a highly-demanded standard in building industrial systems. One factor in this success is the concepts of OPC UA address space and OPC UA information model. OPC UA address space provides a mechanism to represent the resources of an OPC UA server and its field devices as OPC UA nodes. OPC UA information model structures OPC UA nodes as a schema. Once other devices and systems understand the schema, they can interact appropriately with the industrial system. Thus, designing the OPC UA information model is an undeniable and essential practice of OPC UA-based industrial system engineering. However, both academia and industry suffer from a lack of shared experiences on this subject. This gap motivated us to share our experiences on the development of an OPC UA information model. These experiences are based on an actual product assembly line monitoring case study developed at CEA LIST. Overall, in this paper, we aim to throw some light on the steps involved in the transformation of a requirement specification into an OPC UA information model."
14,Querying OPC UA information models with SPARQL,"OPC UA is one of the most important communication protocols for IIoT applications in the automation domain. One important requirement for Industry 4.0 scenarios is standardized semantics, which is introduced into OPC UA through Companion Specifications. Nevertheless, OPC UA still lacks a comfortable interface for accessing these huge graphs, especially on the edge- and cloud-layer. Of course, there is a query language specified for OPC UA. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no publicly available implementation.In this paper, we will present how SPARQL can be used to query OPC UA graphs natively and also will present rules to transform OPC UA queries into SPARQL queries. Furthermore, we will highlight some issues of OPC UA Query and how they can be bypassed by native SPARQL. Finally, we were able to correctly execute all nine example queries of OPC UA Part 4 Annex B (complex examples) with both approaches."
28,Construction of Industrial Internet of Things Based on MQTT and OPC UA Protocols,"At present, the Internet of Things has become a hot area of global concern and is considered to be another major scientific and technological innovation after the Internet. The Internet of Things can be analyzed from two aspects, one is to access the Internet, and the other is the connection between things. The Industrial Internet of Things, as a new type of industrial ecosystem, collects resources and data during the industrial production process by using miniature low-cost controllers and high-bandwidth wireless networks to achieve flexible configuration of manufacturing raw materials and improve resource utilization. The Industrial Internet of Things not only includes traditional software elements, but also requires hardware controllers and sensors, as well as cloud service platforms, to ultimately achieve intelligent manufacturing. The Industrial Internet of Things based on MQTT adopts the method of upper computer (WeChat applet) + server (Alibaba Cloud Server) + lower computer (WiFi module ESP8266 NodeMcu) to realize data collection and control of industrial production process. Based on OPC UA protocol, The Industrial Internet of Things, by designing an intelligent node device based on embedded Linux system, uses Qt to build the OPC UA protocol. OPC UA is a C / S architecture real-time database framework. By building an OPC UA Client on a handheld terminal device, An OPC UA Serve is set up on the smart terminal device, and the information collected by the handheld terminal is sent to the smart terminal. At the same time, multiple smart terminals are connected through the OPC UA protocol to perform data interaction and information transfer. At the same time, an edge computing algorithm is embedded in the smart terminal, and a large amount of data collected is processed for analysis, screening, and calculation. At the same time, the processed information is transmitted or processed. Reduce data interactions between data sources and data centers, and reduce the amount of information transmitted and stored."
52,Cross-Platform Device Monitoring System Based on OPC UA,"With the development of data monitoring system for industrial equipment, the convenience of data monitoring is paid more and more attention. Traditional data monitoring mostly uses specialized software or visual interface on the device to achieve the purpose of monitoring data, the workflow will be more complex. Even if there is a unified device to receive the data, it is not realistic to monitor all the time. In addition, for the load problem of the micro device, mounting the OPC UA client by itself is heavy. Therefore, in order to improve the visibility of field device data, reduce the load of micro devices and simplify the complex workflow, this paper studies the cross-platform device monitoring system based on OPC UA. The local OPC UA server is used to collect data from industrial devices, and the collected data is processed and transferred to the cloud storage system. The stateless RESTful HTTP request style simplifies the complexity of implementing data transfer between a generic client (browser or other HTTP client) and a Web server, and truly enables users to monitor data anytime and anywhere without consuming too many resources."
65,OPC-UA based small-scale monitoring and control solution for android devices case study for water treatment plants,"Interoperability and mobility are important characteristics of modern industrial solutions, providing advantages regarding cost, time and quality. The interoperability perspective emphasizes the OPC UA protocol, respectively the mobility is focusing on technological processes monitored and controlled through smart devices. The current work proposes a small-scale fast and easy to use software solution for Android operating system that will include a Java based OPC UA client and an overlayered application for supervising technological processes. The applicability of the solution is detailed for the water industry and the paper presents a case study for a water treatment facility."
68,Node-Red and OPC UA Based Lightweight and Low-Cost Historian with Application in the Water Industry,"In the context of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), the interoperation of structures and the OPC UA interfacing is of high importance for automation and SCADA systems. Besides process monitoring and control, the historian concept is gaining more and more importance when data circulates vertically and horizontally on automation and supervisory levels. The specificity of the water industry requires a decentralized historian that is able to handle particular needs of local processes. The current work proposes a lightweight and low-cost historian that is applicable on both automation and SCADA levels. The solution consists of a main Java application that embeds the Node-red platform for interfacing with local structures and implements the OPC UA protocol. The developed historian is tested on objectives from the water industry. A water treatment plant test scenario is presented, the results proving the effectiveness of the solution."
77,Modelling an OPC UA client application for predictive maintenance support,"Predictive maintenance is a very important task for each industrial plant. The concept of Industry 4.0 can ensure this service, offering a clever combination of many technologies. This paper presents a method for deploying a software application that provides the maintenance personnel with a useful tool, allowing them to follow the parameters of the process and to prevent its failure. The application has a client-server structure and uses the open platform communications unified architecture (OPC UA) standard and unified architecture transport control protocol (UA TCP) for data communication. The application developed using the proposed method is meant to be a predictive maintenance tool for the blower station of a wastewater treatment plant, so that the maintenance personnel have the necessary data as system health indicators. The maintenance client software shows the personnel the current functional state of the process by synoptic screens. When the maintenance procedures require it, different process states or process parameter values can be accessed from a dedicated Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) database and provide important information to the maintenance personnel (MP)."
81,OPC UA Aggregation Server in the Fog,"Adopting the Fog computing paradigm in traditional Cloud infrastructures reduces latency and optimizes network consumption between data providers and data consumers because the system processes the data closer to its source. However, interoperability issues remain as heterogeneous and distributed data sources with different information models must be accessed for performing Cloud-level processing and analysis. This paper describes an integration architecture based on the OPC UA Aggregation Server paradigm, which introduces Fog-level data processing in industrial automation environments. The proposed architecture allows the creation of a configurable aggregated address space at Fog-level where information from data sources at Edge-level is integrated and served to consumers at Cloud-level. The architecture was tested both to verify that the functional requirements are met, and to analyse the time costs involved in the aggregation of Edge-level servers."
85,Applying OPC-UA for Factory-Wide Industrial Assistance Systems,"Condition monitoring of machines is a building block for efficient production chains. However, monitoring of a single machine does not cover complex faults that occur due to the interactions of different machines in the production chain. To identify these problems, possible causes and the actual defect location within the value chain, is a complex process. Assistance systems solve this by applying artificial intelligence to learn the system behaviour and provide detailed diagnostics and fault predictions covering the complete factory/plant. We aim for an Industry 4.0 compliant system. To achieve that, we use OPC UA to cover the communication between all parts of the assistance system and each assistance system carries an asset administration shell to share information within the network. In this paper, contrary to our previous work, we focus on the communication aspects required to integrate the assistance systems into the corresponding Industry 4.0 environment [1]. Besides that, we discuss options and challenges to extend our approach towards a system with multiple assistance systems in parallel to cover whole factories."
89,An OPC UA-based Crane Model Using Time-Sensitive Networking Technology,"Current control processes in the material handling domain are generally not automated but require manual human intervention. However, the ongoing development towards the Industry 4.0 involves new models and concepts and hence more and more automated control functions will become necessary. That is, devices such as cranes in the material handling domain will become smarter and will also be networked to a larger extent. However, it will be required that control messages passed to the cranes through a network, possibly shared with other traffic, are guaranteed to arrive in time. In this paper, we present an OPC UA-based model of an overhead travelling crane as part of a material handling scenario. The crane can be controlled by a crane remote controller, which we model as well. We use time-sensitive networking technology to ensure deterministic communication between the crane remote controller and the crane. To demonstrate the crane movement, we illustrate it in a simulation before we prove the deterministic communication in a real testbed."
103,Open Source OPC UA Data Traffic Characteristic and Anomaly Detection using Image-Encoding based Convolutional Neural Network,"The development of OT and IT technology and industrial growth requires the design of automation systems that can accommodate scalability and interoperability between devices. OPC UA is a communication protocol that bridges data exchange between devices using different communication platforms and protocols. OPC UA can also connect devices between levels in automation pyramids. As an open platform, open-source OPC UAs such as open62541, OpenOPCUA, and FreeOpcUa is currently being developed by several developer communities. Implementing open-source OPC UA is an attractive option if cost is a significant consideration. However, the primary purpose of implementing OPC UA is to communicate or exchange information effectively and reliably; information about the characteristics and performance of open-source OPC is needed before designing a particular open-source OPC-based automation system platform. This paper utilized FreeOpcUa, a Python OPC UA library, to determine communication traffic features between client and server and perform anomaly detection on the traffic. The results showed that when all clients read server data simultaneously, there was duplication (up to 9%) and loss (up to 5%) of some data packets. Otherwise, the server could read all clientsâ€™ transmitted data. Anomaly detection testing with an image-encoding CNN also showed promising results, with accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score values approaching one."
113,Automated dashboard generation for machine tools with OPC UA compatible sensors,"Manufacturing processes provide large amounts of data which can be captured with current technology. Monitoring dashboards are visualization tools that help turn these data into knowledge in order to enhance production performance by supporting decision-making processes. However, configuring these dashboards can be a resource and time-consuming task when they must be tailored and customized among the various applications. The scope of this paper is to automate the configuration process of dashboards in order to ease their employment. In this fashion, end-users can experience a more efficient way of implementing monitoring dashboards on different cases. The idea of this work is to develop a dashboard system which provides autoconfiguration and adaptability. To achieve these goals, a modular automation concept is implemented. These features are demonstrated in a proof-of-concept called Automated Monitoring Dashboard (AMD) and its development is presented in this paper."
115,Integrating an XPath-Enhanced OPC UA Data Collection Into Industrial Communication,"Recent trends lead to more and more available data from automated manufacturing systems. Many data scientists collect data from production machines via the fast and widespread OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) communication protocol. However, heterogeneous vendor-specific configurations require high manual effort for establishing new data collections, and therefore valuable metadata is either extracted hard-coded or not at all. Our previous publication tackled this challenge purely from a computer science perspective and proposed a transformation of the query language XPath to OPC UA to enable more convenient and expressive queries. Remaining open research questions include a more sophisticated data collection from multiple automated manufacturing systems and proper integration into enterprise-scaled industrial communication systems.This paper focuses the manufacturing perspective and covers these research questions with a real-world implementation for a 500 tons High Pressure Die Casting (HPDC) production cell with six embedded OPC UA servers. We formulate XPath queries and apply these to augment the current workflow, which only extracts raw sensor values, to a more comprehensive one that additionally captures metadata such as units, value ranges, and measurement precision. Our main contributions include an aggregation of multiple individual data collection setups into a general one and an embedding of these into a fully-fledged data lake integration. The results demonstrate an integration of an XPath-enhanced OPC UA data collection into industrial communication for automated manufacturing systems, which dramatically reduces complexity and manual effort for experts."
117,Research on CNC Machine Tool Monitoring System Based on OPC UA,"As one of the core equipment of intelligent manufacturing, the condition monitoring of CNC machine tool is the key of intelligent manufacturing. In this paper, the heterogeneous data standardization specification is implemented by establishing an expandable CNC machine tool description model, the CNC machine tool monitoring system based on OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) is designed, which is applied to Golding CNC system GJ430 for test verification, and the standardization communication of the NC system is implemented."
120,Design for Low Latency and High Reliability: OPC-UA Based Production Line for Product Traceability and Customized Service,"With the growing popularity of edge computing and Industry 4.0, the Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) has emerged as a promising alternative to improve the production efficiency of the manufacturing system. Among various intelligent manufacturing features, product traceability and customized service are highly desired, which not only enables the tracking of the end to end inventory to ensure high reliability, but also provides personalized characteristics to meet different customer demands. However, in tradition, such traceability or customized service are achieved at the cost additional time-consuming steps and hence incur more manufacturing cost. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a low latency OPC-UA based IIoT system and apply that to the production line for product traceability and customized service. The designed OPC-UA is deployed at the edge gateway to effectively solve the data heterogeneity, support centralized control of network resources, and ensure low latency and high reliability of data transmission. In addition, the inter-communication mechanism among multiple devices on the same production line is improved to enable both flexibility and robustness. Experimental results on a demo production line show that the proposed architecture can help achieve both low latency and high reliability."
166,Practical Implementation of an OPC UA TSN Communication Architecture for a Manufacturing System,"In modern manufacturing systems, various industrial communication systems (e.g., fieldbus systems and industrial Ethernet networks) have been used to realize reliable information exchange. However, these industrial communication solutions are largely incompatible with each other, which do not satisfy the new requirements of Industry 4.0. Recently Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) has been developed to improve the real-time capabilities to the standard Ethernet, and is considered to be a promising real-time communication solution for Industry 4.0. In this work, we propose a communication architecture for a manufacturing system using the Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA) and TSN technologies. TSN is adopted as the communication backbone to connect heterogeneous industrial automation subsystems. The OPC UA is adopted to realize horizontal and vertical communication between subsystems in the field layer and the entities of the upper layers. We implement a laboratory-level manufacturing system to validate the proposed architecture. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and capability of the proposed architecture. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of a key TSN substandard, i.e., IEEE 802.1Qbv, in the laboratory-level manufacturing system. The evaluation results demonstrate that IEEE 802.1Qbv can indeed provide excellent real-time capabilities for industrial applications."
172,A Novel Smart Production Line Data Perception System Based on OPC UA,"With the rapid development of information and communication technology (ICT), traditional manufacturing is undergoing an upgrade and transformation to smart manufacturing. In order to achieve intelligent management and control of production process, data perception (DP) is the primary problem to be investigated during the transformation of current production line (PL). However, due to the numerous equipment types, heterogeneous communication protocols and interfaces, the cyber system and the physical world are severely separated, resulting in the phenomenon of information islands. In this paper, we propose a novel DP system architecture for smart production line (SPL) based on OPC UA, which is compatible with multiple device system protocols as well as provides a unified interaction interface for data-driven applications. Data collection and result feedback based on the protocol mapping and conversion are realized by flexibly utilizing two communication patterns of OPC UA, namely client-server (CS) and publish-subscribe (PubSub). The local and cloud case studies strongly verify the feasibility and prospect of the DP system."
179,GraphQL Interface for OPC UA,"Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems consist of multiple machines working together and demand efficient and flexible communication methods to function as intended. The protocols used in industrial operations and web applications are often contradictory in regards to the latency and security characteristics. Due to these differences, the intersection of operation and information technologies is a challenging area. But the rewards in smoother information flow are also high, providing a fruitful area for development. This paper introduces a general wrapper application to enable the use of the industrial OPC UA server through an interface implemented with web technology GraphQL. The results demonstrate sufficient performance for the middleware to be used in an overhead crane control application, bringing the agility of web development to industrial environments."
196,A Prefatory Study on Data Channelling Mechanism towards Industry 4.0,"Data are increasing in volume, variety and velocity in this Internet of things and big data era. It applies from industry (or manufacturing) process monitoring control to video surveillance analysis to track human and machines activities. Therefore, fast and accurate approaches in data channelling are needed to effectively deal with these big data. This paper presents practical methods to manage and transfer the data from industry manufacturing site to a centralized data processing hub. In this hub, data are transformed into understandable information, which can assist human in understanding and monitoring manufacturing situation autonomously. These data are collected and channelled to desired location for analysis through Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture (OPC UA). Industrial protocols and standards are used to interpret the data channelling methods and tested on several industrial machines. Result shows that size of data and number of OPC UA Client that connects to OPC Server affects the data channelling speed."
211,Fault Detection Assessment using an extended FMEA and a Rule-based Expert System,"Early fault detection and diagnosis lead to enhanced production performance since the companies can avoid unplanned machines downtimes and final product quality issues. Expert systems are widely popular in the industry for fault detection and diagnosis applications. This is due to its easy implementation, and its versatility to transform expert knowledge into rules. This paper proposes an extended FMEA (eFMEA) as a systematic knowledge extraction tool to detail the failure causes of equipment in an industrial process. It outlines a methodology for the automatic generation of expert knowledge rules through the digitalisation of the eFMEA. The last contribution is a rule-based expert system for multi-fault detection and diagnosis based on the digitalised eFMEA. This expert system uses the communication protocol OPC-UA to feed the current data from the equipment, to detect faults. It can detect multi-faults simultaneously. The fault detection and diagnosis are visualised through a web application."
212,Towards Formal Monitoring of Workpieces in Agile Manufacturing,"Information about the locations of objects is one of the main ingredients of Industry 4.0. With the increased use of flexible and agile manufacturing techniques, the monitoring of workpieces in a factory can become more challenging. In this paper, we present a state-machine-based approach for monitoring workpieces using sensors such as RFID readers. We present a solution where each object is represented as a deterministic state machine to monitor the object's journey throughout production via this state machine representation. Multiple objects can be monitored at the same time by running parallel event-based state machines. We present an implementation of our solution using RFID-Readers and OPC UA."
219,Workshop Management and Control System Based on Digital Twin,"Aiming at the connotation and characteristics of digital twin, and improving the level of informatization and intelligence of the workshop, a workshop management and control system based on digital twins is proposed, which can realize the management and control of the full life cycle of digital twins. Based on the physical production line model of the digital twin, the virtual and real joint debugging method of the digital twin workshop is constructed: the controller controls the virtual model, and the virtual model drives the simulation. The operation and control model of the digital twin is driven through the communication framework of OPC UA (Object Linking and Embedding for Process Unified Architecture), and the virtual and real interaction of the physical production line is used to timely reflect the operation of the workshop. From model building, model digital drive, virtual and real control joint debugging, to full life cycle workshop verification and design simulation, the visual monitoring of the digital twin workshop is finally realized."
222,Design and Application of Cloud Platform Based on OpenStack in Remote Online Collection and Monitoring System of Intelligent Workshop,"With the development of information technology, network technology, Internet technology, cloud computing technology and so on are more and more widely used in various industries. The traditional industrial automation hierarchy structure is complex and the integration degree is not high. It can not meet the development needs of informationization and intelligence, and is limited by the site infrastructure. Therefore, this paper designs a remote online acquisition and monitoring system architecture for intelligent workshop based on OpenStack private cloud computing, which completes the functions of data acquisition, online monitoring, database management and real-time control. In addition, this paper also considers the characteristics of the system architecture, such as filing, disaster tolerance and security. Using OPC UA protocol and Modbus RTU protocol to complete data acquisition, data interaction between the bottom of the factory and the bottom of the enterprise. At the same time, cloud computing data center centralized storage and management of the collected data, which provides great convenience for the follow-up analysis of large data in the workshop, and has a certain practical value."
223,Analyzing Manufacturing Data in a Digital Control Room Making Use of Semantic Annotations,"The German manufacturing industry carries out new developments towards Industry 4.0, which focus on smart factories and smart assistance systems. In this paper, we present our digital control room for analyzing manufacturing data aiming at optimizing production processes. It builds upon our digital boardroom - a multi-display environment integrating multitouch and multiuser-based annotation dashboards so that decision makers gain insights into and can discuss an organization's data. In particular, our digital control room integrates the OPC UA protocol, semantic annotations, and a time series database to analyze, visualize and interact with machine data. Thereby, it can combine real time, near-real time, and batch processing of machine data and constitutes a holistic business intelligence environment."
224,"SCADA System Framework for Monitoring, Controlling and Data Logging of Industrial Processing Plants","In this research, an advancement of an open source administrative control and information obtaining Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition Systems (SCADA) framework is presented. The framework utilizes the universally useful programming platform, Python. The SCADA framework offers correspondence capacities through an open source OPC-UA worker, which comprehends information trade with control gadgets, for example, PLC, PAC, and so on. The framework additionally gives adaptation to non-critical failure highlights because of the execution of a functioning shortcoming open minded control (AFTC) engineering. The proposed approach plays out a three-layer connection of the CIM model, and offers comparable capacities of business SCADA frameworks."
235,Development of a Power Supply Control System and Virtual Simulation Based on Docker,"A proton therapy facility (HUST-PTF) based on a superconducting cyclotron is being developed by Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) and China Academy of Atomic Energy (CIAE). The beam transport system in this facility provides the required beam for the treatment rooms. The beamline control system (BCS) manages the operation of the degrader, beamline magnet power supplies (PS), diagnostics devices, etc. For additional security, BCS utilizes the OPC UA as the distributed control protocol. Since the PS controllers adopt a TCP communication protocol, an OPC UA server with TCP driver is developed as a gateway and front controller for PS control. In order to adapt fast beam-energy change, the ""list-trigger"" strategy is applied to the PS control. BCS downloads the respective current value lists to PS controllers before the treatment, and then triggers the PS controllers by pulse signals to alter the operation current to the next value in the list during the treatment. It is vital to decide when the current regulation process is complete in the transitional period, BCS should update the current values more frequent than the steady state. Therefore, the OPC UA server adopts the node dynamic refresh scheme. A virtual simulation based on docker followed by a thorough analysis are conducted on the PS control system, where the results show the node refresh time of the OPC UA server meets the PS control requirement. The virtual simulation is also proved to be cost-saving and reliable for control system tests and worth promoting."
239,"Supporting the Design, Commissioning and Supervision of Smart Factory Components through their Digital Twin","In a context of greater complexity of Smart Factories, the commissioning time for automated systems needs to be shortened. The use of virtual commissioning tools is a good contribution to achieve this goal. Ideally, those tools should be part of a virtual engineering environment sharing same virtual model, the digital twin, through the complete lifecycle of the automated system, namely the project, simulation, implementation and execution/monitoring/supervision and, eventually decommissioning phases. Such vision includes a digital twin with a broader use, which is consistent with the real system and one that can be used after the early design and commissioning phases. Finding a complete set of tools able to comply with the above requirements can be extremely challenging. In this paper we explore the use of the ABB RobotStudio software combined with the OPC UA standard with this vision in mind. Methodologies were defined to integrate both new generation and legacy equipment, as well as robot controllers and guidelines for equipment development. A key result of this work is the development of a set of virtual engineering tools and methodologies based on OPC UA and implemented using RobotStudio in order to accomplish the complete lifecycle support of an automated system, from the project and simulation phases, to the monitoring and supervision phases, suitable for integration in Industry 4.0 factories. Results are described for a test scenario with different devices."
246,Digitizing a Distributed Textile Production Process using Industrial Internet of Things: A Use-Case,"Many textile production chains are highly fragmented and distributed over several locations and countries. Textile machinery usually relies on proprietary software and hardware that cannot be sufficiently interlinked. As a result, machine and product data is not comprehensively collected and analyzed across the whole production process. Thus, the potential of Smart Manufacturing and Industry 4.0 is often not fully exploited in the textile industry. In recent years, vendor-independent machine to machine communication protocols and standards, such as OPC UA and MQTT have been suggested for the digitization of production facilities by integrating or replacing these proprietary systems. In contrast, there is still a lack of publicly available working demonstrations and exemplary implementations in the textile context. In this paper, we use Industrial Internet of Things technologies to design an open digital infrastructure for textile manufacturing. We develop our approach based on a production use-case that is distributed across multiple locations. By machine networking and integrating information flows from the shop floor to the cloud, we lay the basis for getting most value out of process-wide collected data. Our suggested infrastructure supports the use of Machine Learning techniques to enable various Smart Manufacturing applications, such as Predictive Maintenance and Predictive Quality."
253,Dynamic Control Model Based on State Perception,"The monitoring system built on the OPC UA (object linking and embedding (OLE) for process control unified architecture) protocol cannot detect the congestion of each terminal network and the load pressure of the cluster server nodes in real time. In the case that the number of terminal accesses is increasing and the traffic volume is gradually increasing, some server nodes of the system are overloaded or crash. In response to these questions, this paper presents a dynamic control model based on state perception. This model can perceive the communication state of client and server in real time, and uses the current resource occupancy index of the server and the network congestion indicators of each client as the adjustment conditions. The model algorithm can dynamically adjust the client served by the overload node to the server node with small load. Meanwhile, the model uses the congestion estimation method based on bandwidth estimation to accurately estimate the network conditions of each client and improve the validity of state-aware information. The simulation results show that the model can sense the load of each server and make reasonable adjustments to achieve a good load balancing effect. At the same time, the experiment verifies the feasibility and efficiency of the model."
260,An Approach for Data Pipeline with Distributed Query Engine for Industrial Applications,"The data driven services in industrial automation systems are transforming the world of automation industry by optimizing industrial processes and providing Value Added Services (VASs) with the grace of Industry 4.0, Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI). A demand driven data pipeline is essential to connect different industrial data sources in a shop floor with different data storage systems for service provisioning. This paper analyzes an experimental approach and corresponding challenges to optimize computing resource allocation in industrial applications to construct such demand driven data pipeline to provide data driven services through an open source, flexible and extensible distributed query engine known as Presto, which can perform interactive analytical queries for different purposes such as condition monitoring, asset management or many others."
266,Monitoring of Discrete Electrical Signals from Welding Processes using Data Mining and IIoT Approaches,"Processes such as welding involve consumption of huge amounts of energy leading to generation of significant electrical data consisting of current and voltage signals. The added task is to inspect the quality of welding using such data as early as possible to identify defects in producing welded parts or equipment. From the perspective of machine learning, this paper presents a data mining approach to analyse small sampled amounts of electrical signals to identify welding inconsistencies using conventional methods such as clustering algorithms, time-series and multi-label classifiers. Using unlabelled and discrete signals, an attempt is made to build a process profile on the welding robots with the use of comparison measures such as Jaccard's metric. To monitor such a mechanism, a simulation application based on IIoT standard Open Platform Communication (OPC UA) is developed to present the analysis over secure network servers to clients. The application setup presents a basic monitoring system for welding processes using available technologies like machine learning algorithms and OPC UA."
273,A Cost-Efficient and Continuous Ethernet Cable Diagnosis Technique based on Undersampling,"The monitoring of industrial environments ensures that highly automated processes run without interruption. However, even if the industrial machines themselves are monitored, the communication lines are currently not continuously monitored in todays installations. They are checked usually only during maintenance intervals or in case of error. In addition, the cables or connected machines usually have to be removed from the system for the duration of the test. To overcome these drawbacks, we have developed and implemented a cost-efficient and continuous signal monitoring of Ethernet-based industrial bus systems. Several methods have been developed to assess the quality of the cable. These methods can be classified to either passive or active. Active methods are not suitable if interruption of the communication is undesired. Passive methods, on the other hand, require oversampling, which calls for expensive hardware. In this paper, a novel passive method combined with undersampling targeting cost-efficient hardware is proposed."
