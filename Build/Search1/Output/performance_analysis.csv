5,"Concurrent OPC UA information model access, enabling real-time OPC UA PubSub","Ongoing changes in industrial automation aim to-wards a flat and highly interconnected architecture that includes end-to-end real-time enabled machine-to-machine communications. Several technologies, such as OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) publish-subscribe and time-sensitive networking (TSN), facilitate that change. While OPC UA PubSub and TSN can already provide real-time capabilities, the parallel operation with standard OPC UA client-server remains an open challenge. This article presents preliminary results for solving concurrent information model access between OPC UA PubSub and client-server. The results include the overall RT-TSN-OPC UA concept, an analysis of common concurrent data access mechanisms for their suitability, and identifying critical code segments in the open62541 OPC UA stack. The paper concludes by outlining further research focusing on implementing and evaluating a wait-and obstruction-free mechanism into open62541."
14,Querying OPC UA information models with SPARQL,"OPC UA is one of the most important communication protocols for IIoT applications in the automation domain. One important requirement for Industry 4.0 scenarios is standardized semantics, which is introduced into OPC UA through Companion Specifications. Nevertheless, OPC UA still lacks a comfortable interface for accessing these huge graphs, especially on the edge- and cloud-layer. Of course, there is a query language specified for OPC UA. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no publicly available implementation.In this paper, we will present how SPARQL can be used to query OPC UA graphs natively and also will present rules to transform OPC UA queries into SPARQL queries. Furthermore, we will highlight some issues of OPC UA Query and how they can be bypassed by native SPARQL. Finally, we were able to correctly execute all nine example queries of OPC UA Part 4 Annex B (complex examples) with both approaches."
22,Black-Box Analysis of the Publish-Subscribe Notification Latency in Real OPC UA Servers,"Among the many enabling technologies Industry 4.0 relies on, the Industrial Internet of Things is a relevant one that enables both horizontal and vertical integration in modern enterprises, to accomplish complex functions that exploit either cloud or edge processing. In particular, the OPC UA protocol is knowing an ever increasing attention for interconnecting devices, equipment, and facilities in next-generation plants. This work focuses on the characterization of the notification latency in distributed systems that rely on the OPC UA publish-subscribe paradigm for interactions. In particular, starting from a black-box experimental evaluation carried out on real setups, we tried to explain the seemingly peculiar behavior of some popular solutions by means of theoretical models complemented with code inspection."
27,Real-time capable OPC-UA Programs over TSN for distributed industrial control,"A key aspect of Industry 4.0 is the continuous interconnectedness of components. The standardized industrial communication protocol OPC UA offers a solution to this problem by enabling the exchange of data between the shop floor level and the inter-enterprise level. Due to the integration of the Time Sensitive Network (TSN) into OPC UA, it is now even possible to exchange information in real-time. Especially on the shop floor, there are numerous heterogeneous distributed devices from sensors to robots which must communicate with each other in real-time to achieve a distributed industrial control. Therefore, we propose an approach to combine real-time communication over TSN with OPC UA Programs to synchronize multiple distributed OPC UA Programs and exchange process data between them without losing real-time guarantees. This can be seen as the enabler of Plug-and-Produce with real-time requirements."
33,Towards an Industrial Converged Network with OPC UA PubSub and TSN,"Technologies such as TSN and OPC UA are enablers for converged networks in industrial applications. TSN enables the coexistence of network traffic with real-time requirements and best-effort requirements. On the other hand, OPC UA defines a common information model in addition to secure communication, scalability, and platform independence. The new specification of OPC UA PubSub enables the possibility of implementing OPC UA on the lower levels of the automation pyramid, the field level. Therefore, combining these two technologies can in principle be implemented for every vertical and horizontal communication. This document analyzes the state of the art of OPC UA over TSN and explains the first steps towards an easy to use proof-of-concept for a converged network that is also designed to be a testbed. The testbed will be used to evaluate the interoperability of TSN-capable devices from different vendors. In addition to that, different OPC UA PubSub implementations will be used and benchmarked. These future results will present an overview of the currently available products and provides hands-on experiences for practical implementations of converged networks."
34,Overview of OPC UA TSN,"Ethernet has become a very extensive communication protocol standard for the intercommunication and connection of enterprises, homes and even data center networks. However, with the rapid development of network technology and the expansion of vertical industry applications, at the data transmission level, there will be higher requirements for the certainty, real-time, and reliability of network transmission. The traditional Ethernet channel access method is based on competition, and cannot meet the real-time requirements of various industries. The OPC UA TSN combination emerges spontaneously. The communication network provided by this combination is not only highly deterministic and real-time, but more importantly, it realizes the true independence of the communication network from equipment manufacturers, in terms of network security, bandwidth, interoperability, synchronization, and delay. It has brought huge improvements. It has to be said that the OPC UA TSN combination is the best partner for establishing a comprehensive network between the sensor and the cloud."
39,Implementation and Performance Analysis of Power and Cost-Reduced OPC UA Gateway for Industrial IoT Platforms,"OPC UA is an international standard for smart factories that defines communication technologies and data processing methods. Therefore, OPC UA supports high interoperability among various protocols and plays an important role in building Smart Factory. However, changing a factory using a variety of existing devices and protocols to a device using a single protocol is, in reality, a barrier to entry due to the enormous cost and lack of experimentation. Therefore, this paper proposes OPC UA gateway that can accommodate OPC UA specification in industrial device platform based on ARM processor. Evaluate performance based on indicators such as publication interval, sampling interval, subscription limit, encryption and security guidelines. Our experimental results show that operating costs are reduced by about 66% compared to x86 processors. It also provides a way to reduce costs over older systems by connecting Microsoft's Azure IoT cloud."
41,Research and application of OPC UA server based on resource constrained platform STM32,"In view of the rapid development trend of intelligent manufacturing and the application status of OPC UA protocol in the field of intelligent manufacturing, the requirement of building OPC UA server on resource constrained platform is proposed. By building STM32 platform and FreeRTOS system environment, the transplantation and operation of OPC UA protocol stack in resource limited platform are realized, the main memory space occupied by OPC UA protocol stack is analyzed, and the implementation path is proposed for later optimization. Through experimental verification, the OPC UA protocol stack runs on the resource limited platform, and the server can be widely used and popularized in the resource limited platform."
50,Conceptual Framework of Smart Factory Based on OPC UA and LSTM Encoder-Decoder,"OPC UA (Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture) is key for multi-heterogeneous software and hardware information integration. Some studies have proposed to apply OPC UA to smartfactory information integration, but most tend to propose concepts and lack application research. While, LSTM Encoder-Decoder (Long Short-Term Memory based Encoder-decoder) is an unsupervised learning method not requiring labeled data. It has good performance in time series data analysis, but few researches relate it with smart factory predictive analysis. This paper proposed a conceptual framework of smart factory based on OPC UA and LSTM Encoder-Decoder technology. Specifically, first, the theories are discussed including the general architecture of smart factory, information integration architecture based on OPC UA and LSTM Encoder-decoder model for smart factory predictive analysis. Then, we introduced the simulation result analysis. Finally, the conclusion was given."
54,Towards Performance Benchmarking of Cyclic OPC UA PubSub over TSN,"PubSub is a recent introduction to a widely-accepted industrial communication protocol OPC UA. It is driven by OPC Foundation Field eXchange group (ex-FLC, ex-Shapers) to enable real-time OPC UA over TSN for cyclic communication in industrial automation. Furthermore, evolution of Soft Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) to Virtual PLCs entails a wider use of software stacks and applications expected to provide necessary level of performance, which might be influenced by various configuration options of the application, the OPC UA stack, and the underlying operating system. In this work we address this issue with an experimental setup for benchmarking of cyclic PubSub applications using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and a state-of-the-art open-source OPC UA PubSub stack. Experimental results show achievable jitter and cycle times for different message sizes, SDK options, and OS configurations."
57,Hardware Implementation of an OPC UA Server for Industrial Field Devices,"Industrial plants suffer from a high degree of complexity and incompatibility in their communication infrastructure, caused by a wild mix of proprietary technologies. This prevents transformation toward Industry 4.0 and the Industrial Internet of Things. Open platform communications unified architecture (OPC UA) is a standardized protocol that addresses these problems with uniform and semantic communication across all levels of the hierarchy. However, its adoption in embedded field devices, such as sensors and actuators, is still lacking due to prohibitive memory and power requirements of software implementations. We have developed a dedicated hardware engine that offloads processing of the OPC UA protocol and enables the realization of compact and low-power field devices with OPC UA support. As part of a proof-of-concept embedded system, we have implemented this engine in a 22-nm FDSOI technology, representing the first ASIC implementation of an OPC UA server. We measured performance, power consumption, and memory footprint of our test chip and compared it with a software implementation based on open62541 and a Raspberry Pi 2B. Our OPC UA hardware engine is 50 times more energy efficient and only requires 36 KiB of memory. The complete system consumes only 24 mW under full load, making it suitable for low-power embedded applications."
58,Performance Comparison Between OPC UA and MQTT for Data Exchange,"With the new concepts brought by the Industry 4.0 and the Internet of Things (IoT), it is expected more equipment communicating with each other, using local and cloud computing servers. In order to the communication between the devices be efficient, fast and with time deterministic, it is necessary to choose a suitable network protocol. In this context, the article presents the performance comparison of quantity of used data and time spent to send and receive messages in two well-known protocols in the field of IoT and Industrial loT (IIoT): MQTT and OPC UA. The obtained values show the advantages of using each protocol in several scenarios, in order to exploit the best data exchange between devices."
60,Real-time Industrial Communication by using OPC UA Field Level Communication,"Real-time behaviour is one of the most important aspects of field level automation networks in factory communication. Various Real-Time Ethernet (RTE) technologies have been developed over the years to cope with the network requirements like latency, Quality-of-Service (QoS), reliability etc. of the field level networks. Because of their nature of vendor-dependency, these technologies have been incompatible with one another. In the era of Industry 4.0, an innovative approach is required to bring together this technology in order to solve the interoperability issue. Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture (OPC UA) is a vendor-neutral communication protocol which can be an answer to this incompatibility problem of field level factory networks. This paper aims to use OPC UA as a field level communication protocol in combination with the Time-sensitive networking (TSN) standards to simulate the real-time behaviour of field network."
63,Analysis of the Round Trip Time of OPC UA and TSN based Peer-to-Peer Communication,"At the SPS IPC Drives in Germany a joint working group between the leading automation manufacturers announced to work together on a set of vendor independent standards for the next generation of industrial communication products. This set of standards is based on OPC UA and Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) and shall be used throughout the automation pyramid. This work contributes to analyze the performance of OPC UA and TSN. Therefore, a test framework is implemented to measure the round trip time of a peer-to-peer communication. The round trip time is an important performance indicator for controller-to-controller and controller-to-field device use cases."
81,OPC UA Aggregation Server in the Fog,"Adopting the Fog computing paradigm in traditional Cloud infrastructures reduces latency and optimizes network consumption between data providers and data consumers because the system processes the data closer to its source. However, interoperability issues remain as heterogeneous and distributed data sources with different information models must be accessed for performing Cloud-level processing and analysis. This paper describes an integration architecture based on the OPC UA Aggregation Server paradigm, which introduces Fog-level data processing in industrial automation environments. The proposed architecture allows the creation of a configurable aggregated address space at Fog-level where information from data sources at Edge-level is integrated and served to consumers at Cloud-level. The architecture was tested both to verify that the functional requirements are met, and to analyse the time costs involved in the aggregation of Edge-level servers."
100,Standalone OPC UA Wrapper for Industrial Monitoring and Control Systems,"OPC unified architecture (UA), a communication standard for the manufacturing industry, enables exchanging control and management data among distributed entities in industrial automation systems. OPC UA wrapper is a migration strategy that provides UA clients with seamless access to legacy servers having OPC classic interfaces. This paper presents the design of a standalone OPC UA wrapper and discusses its performance through extensive experiments using a prototype implementation. The wrapper consists of two main components, i.e., UA server and classic client, which communicate with each other via shared memory and semaphore. One important feature of the design is that it employs a distributed component object model runtime library implemented in Java for platform independence. This makes it possible to build a cost-competitive wrapper system by using commercial off-the-shelf non-Windows solutions with low-cost microprocessors. Another key feature is the event-driven update interface between the UA and classic components, which we propose as an alternative to the sampling-based mechanism for the reduced delay. Through experiments using workloads from an industrial monitoring system, we present a systematic approach of identifying the system parameters having a direct impact on the wrapper performance and eventually tuning them such that the read and subscription services of OPC UA exhibit the best performance."
101,The Role of OPC UA TSN in IT and OT Convergence,"The Industrial Internet is a kind of infrastructure that is closely connected with people, industries, and network, and it can realize the low cost and high efficiency of intelligent production. Promoting the convergence of Information Technology (IT) and Operation Technology (OT) is the foundation to realize the Industrial Internet. However, IT and OT exist independently and cannot be unified all the time. How can they work together effectively? We describe the model of OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) and Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) in this paper that will effectively solve the problem of IT and OT convergence. We also compare three TSN models, discuss which obstacles to IT and OT convergence will be addressed by OPC UA TSN in detail, and analyze the features of OPC UA TSN. It proves that OPC UA TSN will play an important role in the process of IT and OT convergence."
104,Static Timing Analysis of OPC UA PubSub,"Industrial automation is changing towards higher integration and seamless communication. A stepping stone is end-to-end real-time machine-to-machine communication, now becoming feasible with technologies such as time-sensitive networking (TSN) and OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) publish-subscribe. While TSN takes care of communication, the OPC UA stack's execution time behavior remains unknown. This paper highlights experiences made while adjusting the OPC UA subscriber of the open62541 stack for worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis. Two directly connected time-predictable T-CREST platforms hosting the publisher and subscriber delivered end-to-end timing measures validating the WCET estimates. The paper concludes by outlining further research with several time-predictable publishers and subscribers."
106,Timing Analysis of TSN-Enabled OPC UA PubSub,"Industrial automation is changing towards a flat and highly interconnected architecture, with requirements for end-to-end real-time enabled machine-to-machine communications. Technologies such as time-sensitive networking (TSN) and OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) publish-subscribe provide the necessary features. While TSN is well explored, OPC UA's execution time behavior remains unknown. This article presents findings made while extending the open62541 OPC UA Pub Sub stack with the 802.1q VLAN tag to enable IEEE 802.1Qbv time-aware scheduling. The results include end-to-end timing measures and worst-case execution time analyses considering various payloads. Time-predictable T-CREST platforms host the publisher and subscriber, and a TSN network handles message transmission. The paper concludes by outlining further research focusing on dynamic memory access, buffer management, and the inclusion of non-priority access to the Ethernet port."
112,Evaluation and Extension of OPC UA Publish/Subscribe MQTT Binding,"Currently, Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture (OPC UA) is nominated as a reference standard to meet all Industry 4.0 demands with one protocol, enabling an efficient communication between devices in industrial systems. Recently, OPC UA has been extended by a publish/subscribe pattern to support multicast communication since there is a need for an efficient data aggregation and distribution to cope with the increasing number of controllers, sensors, and measured values in industries. Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is the most widely used publish/subscribe communication protocol and is based on a central broker for message exchange. In this paper, the communication latency of OPC UA end devices exchanging data over MQTT as a broker-based middleware is investigated and compared to the client/server-based communication. In particular, we analyze the use case of one-to-many communication for a crane model from the material handling domain. We provide a prototype implementation of the OPC UA MQTT extension and our evaluation results show the reduced traffic overhead and communication latency compared to client/server-based communication."
114,Applying Event-Based Sending Intervals to Enable Low Energy OPC-UA on Sensor Nodes,"Integrating typical wireless sensors into industrial control systems is a crucial task to realize the full potential of the Industrial Internet of Things (IoT). Many lightweight protocols exist for the use in the IoT context with a focus on energy efficient data transmissions. Industrial protocols on the other hand ensure reliable and timely transfer of data but typically at the cost of a higher energy consumption. In this paper, we analyze and compare one protocol from each category to determine the different energy consumption and then evaluate how different sending schemes can enhance the energy consumption of the industrial protocol. The goal is to reduce the energy consumption while keeping the relevant information under industrial constraints and enabling tuning to different scenarios. Our results show that these goals are achievable by applying event-based sending approaches. However, a good understanding of the process at hand is required to trade-off different constraints."
115,Integrating an XPath-Enhanced OPC UA Data Collection Into Industrial Communication,"Recent trends lead to more and more available data from automated manufacturing systems. Many data scientists collect data from production machines via the fast and widespread OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) communication protocol. However, heterogeneous vendor-specific configurations require high manual effort for establishing new data collections, and therefore valuable metadata is either extracted hard-coded or not at all. Our previous publication tackled this challenge purely from a computer science perspective and proposed a transformation of the query language XPath to OPC UA to enable more convenient and expressive queries. Remaining open research questions include a more sophisticated data collection from multiple automated manufacturing systems and proper integration into enterprise-scaled industrial communication systems.This paper focuses the manufacturing perspective and covers these research questions with a real-world implementation for a 500 tons High Pressure Die Casting (HPDC) production cell with six embedded OPC UA servers. We formulate XPath queries and apply these to augment the current workflow, which only extracts raw sensor values, to a more comprehensive one that additionally captures metadata such as units, value ranges, and measurement precision. Our main contributions include an aggregation of multiple individual data collection setups into a general one and an embedding of these into a fully-fledged data lake integration. The results demonstrate an integration of an XPath-enhanced OPC UA data collection into industrial communication for automated manufacturing systems, which dramatically reduces complexity and manual effort for experts."
119,Quarry: An open source tool for OPC UA SPARQL queries over hybrid architectures using query rewriting,"OPC UA is an open set of specifications for communication and modelling that have found extensive use in industrial automation. OPC UA information models are part of the specification and are used by asset owners and equipment vendors to describe the static parameters and time varying signals belonging to equipment in standardized ways. Such descriptions are aimed to drastically reduce the cost of integrating software managing these industrial assets. Hindering the adoption of OPC UA information models is their inherent complexity and the problematic specification of query support. Previous research has implemented the OPC UA query specification using SPARQL and found that formulating queries in SPARQL natively provides shorter queries that are easier to formulate. However, parts of the OPC UA graph are time-varying, and may index large time series data sets, which are sub-optimally handled by most available SPARQL databases. We show how OPC UA can be mapped to the Semantic Web in a way that allows a hybrid approach where time series data is stored in a specialized system and describe a query rewriting approach that allows for joint queries over static OPC UA information models and time series data. Compared to existing approaches, we argue that our approach is better suited for analytics applications that require portability across infrastructure and allows a greater range of SPARQL engines. A prototype implementation called Quarry is open sourced under the Apache 2.0 license to improve the accessibility and reproducibility of this research area."
135,Real-Time Communication Model Based on OPC UA Wireless Network for Intelligent Production Line,"With the continuous development of intelligent manufacturing technology, the intelligent production line for the Industrial Internet of Things occupies an important position in the field of industrial intelligence. OPC UA is a standard for communication data exchange between intelligent production line devices. OPC UA can establish a unified information model for production line devices and improve the connectivity of heterogeneous networks. However, in industrial wireless network application scenarios, there are various types of sensing information and large amounts of data to be transmitted. Each type of data has different requirements for real-time. The traditional OPC UA communication method is difficult to achieve real-time and reliable transmission in intelligent production lines and canâ€™t meet the transmission requirements of time-sensitive data. In this paper, we propose a real-time communication model of the OPC UA wireless network for intelligent production lines (UAMPDS). IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH is used as the wireless communication infrastructure, and OPC UA protocols are fused to this model. Meanwhile, we design a load-aware time-slot scheduling algorithm to dynamically allocate and schedule time slots according to the network topology and traffic load of each node. We also implement a dynamic preemptive resource scheduling strategy based on service differentiation to ensure real-time transmission of time-sensitive data. The experimental results show that this model achieves differentiated services based on data with different latency tolerance and effectively reduces the transmission latency of real-time service data under the constrained network resources. It can avoid the starvation phenomenon of low priority queues, and improves the overall quality of service of intelligent production line communication networks."
146,Configurable Mapping of EtherCAT field-level devices to OPC UA,"Digital transformation in an industrial sector enables new possibilities towards economical, highly flexible and resource-saving production. Significantly involved in this transformation are standardized software interfaces to enable read and write access to the data provided by automation devices from different manufacturers. Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture (OPC UA) is a widely used industrial communication middleware and ensures interoperability between the devices. Companion specifications in OPC UA offer a possibility to map domain-specific data models to OPC UA information models. However, these specifications usually define a static mapping and often enable complete access to various field-level properties. Therefore, a configurable mapping of field-level properties to OPC UA is desirable. This paper focuses on the development and investigation of a configurable information model for mapping the EtherCAT communication standard to OPC UA. The feasibility of the configurable information model has been validated by an experimental setup composed of an embedded Personal Computer (PC) and several EtherCAT field-level devices."
158,Assessment of Different OPC UA Implementations for Industrial IoT-Based Measurement Applications,"The industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) paradigm represents an attractive opportunity for new generation measurement applications, which are increasingly based on efficient and reliable communication systems to allow the extensive availability of continuous data from instruments and/or sensors, thus enabling real-time measurement analysis. Nevertheless, different communication systems and heterogeneous sensors and acquisition systems may be found in an IIoT-enabled measurement application, so that solutions need to be defined to tackle the issue of seamless, effective, and low-latency interoperability. A significant and appropriate solution is the open platform communications (OPCs) unified architecture (UA) protocol, thanks to its object-oriented structure that allows a complete contextualization of the information. The intrinsic complexity of OPC UA, however, imposes meaningful performance assessment to evaluate its suitability in the aforementioned context. To this aim, this article presents the design of a general yet accurate and reproducible measurement setup that will be exploited to assess the performance of the main open-source implementations of OPC UA. The final goal of this work is to provide a characterization of the impact of this protocol stack in an IIoT-enabled measurement system, in particular, in terms of both the latency introduced in the measurement process and the power consumption."
164,An Introduction to OPC UA TSN for Industrial Communication Systems,"The industrial communication market is dominated by Ethernet-based fieldbus systems. Although they share similar requirements and market segments, their implementations and ecosystems differ considerably. As a result, end customers and device manufacturers are faced with a multitude of technologies that need to be produced, run, diagnosed, maintained, and kept in stock. Although the availability of products and services is largely satisfactory, dealing with multiple solutions generates high costs and limits IoT capability. This paper introduces Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture Time-Sensitive Networking (OPC UA TSN) as a new technology and presents the current view. This time, the industrial prospects of fulfilling industrial communication requirements while leveraging the cost benefits of standard Ethernet hardware in the midterm are in reach. We anticipate that OPC UA TSN will reveal itself as a game changer in the field of industrial automation, being a candidate for establishing a holistic communication infrastructure from the sensor to the cloud."
168,Assessment of Different OPC UA Industrial IoT solutions for Distributed Measurement Applications,"The Industrial IoT scenario represents an interesting opportunity for distributed measurements systems, that are typically based on efficient and reliable communication systems, as well as the widespread availability of data from measurement instruments and/or sensors. The Open Platform Communications (OPC) Unified Architecture (UA) protocol is designed to ensure interoperability between heterogeneous sensors and acquisition systems, given its objectâ€“oriented structure allowing a complete contextualization of the information. Stemming from the intrinsic complexity of OPC UA, we designed an experimental measurement setup to carry out a meaningful performance assessment of its main open source implementations. The aim is to characterize the impact of the adoption of this protocol stack in a DMS in terms of both latency and power consumption, and to provide a general yet accurate and reproducible measurement setup."
169,Charging Station Selection through the Analytic Hierarchy Process enabled by OPC-UA for Vehicle-to-Grid Communications,"During the last decade, the technologies related to the electric vehicles capture both the scientific and the industrial interest. In this context, the Smart Grid philosophy with the Vehicle-to-Grid concept poses a major role for the prevalence of the electric vehicles. Despite the presence of extended literature in the topic, the interoperability of different systems through well-adopted standards is still a challenge. Aiming to address this challenge and to support decision-making in a smart grid, this paper proposes a framework for the charging station selection in the case of electric vehicles. The framework employs the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Open Platform Communications-Unified Architecture (OPC-UA) standard. Specifically, the AHP is utilised to solve the multicriteria decision-making problem during the selection of the most appropriate charging station that will fulfil the needs of the electric vehicle driver. In addition, the OPC-UA enables the semantic modelling of the electric vehicle integrating all the interrelationships among the various subsystems and their components. As a result, a seamless information flow can be resulted among systems designed using different engineering disciplines (power electronics, mechanical, microelectronics, etc). The proposed framework is validated in the case study of a laboratory electric vehicle that is designed for urban transportations."
171,Experimental Characterization of Asynchronous Notification Latency for Subscriptions in OPC UA,"The past few decades saw factory and process automation move from monolithic to fully distributed architectures, where the communication system plays a key role in providing higher flexibility and availability, yet fitting the peculiar requirements of such contexts. As part of the Industry 4.0 (r)evolution, the Industrial Internet of Things is meant to achieve full convergence toward well-agreed non-proprietary digital networking technologies. In this scenario, OPC UA is becoming increasingly relevant as a high-level protocol to exchange information in heterogeneous distributed industrial applications. In this paper, the performance of OPC UA has been evaluated by means of an experimental measurement campaign carried out on real devices connected to real networks. In particular, we analyzed how much the end-to-end notification latency achieved by the subscription mechanism is affected by the position and interconnection of devices, their specific implementation, and configuration parameters. Outcomes can be helpful in designing systems where industrial devices interact with local workstations, the edge, and the cloud, to understand whether or not timing constraints of applications will be met."
181,Improving interoperability of Virtual Commissioning toolchains by using OPC-UA-based technologies,"It is well-known that one the most important challenges in industrial manufacturing processes is the reduction of lead-times and delays during the on-site commissioning. In applications in which several automation systems are used, such as in aeronautics or automotive manufacturing cells, several PLC's and drives are used to control the motion of the different electromechanical components. In order to verify and validate (V&V) automation code before deployment in the production environment, virtual commissioning (VC) techniques have become of great interest in the last decades. Even if VC simulation approaches, based on software/hardware-in-the-loop (SiL, HiL), have shown effectiveness to V&V automation code, the continuity from the execution to the simulation layers may not be ensured due to a lack of interoperability in the toolchain. Additionally, the development of reliable component models is a complex task of the VC solution since it requires a high level of mechatronics expertise. In order to avoid losing information between the execution and the simulation layers of VC toolchains, this paper presents a SiL based approach for interconnecting the PLC's with the VC simulation tool by means of OPC-UA-based technologies. In addition, in order to develop the functional models, we propose a library-based development. This will facilitate seamless flow of information between different PLC editors and the simulation layer. SiL simulations of the suggested approach on an automotive manufacturing cell are performed and show digital continuity from the execution to the simulation layer."
187,Industrial IoT Smartbox for the Shop Floor,"Constant search for efficiency and productivity has led to innovation on the factory shop floor, representing an evolution of the current production systems combined with new technologies of industrial automation and information technology. This work presents an experimental demo of a smartbox for Industry 4.0 scenarios, allowing sensing, monitoring and data acquisition. We have tested two different approaches, depending on the communication protocol used for real time applications: OPC UA or MQTT. Raspberry Pi's platform act as an OPC UA server or MQTT broker, respectively. From the measurements, data stored in a cloud server can be accessed remotely with improved security and visualized from a computer dashboard. One of the conclusions that can be drawn is that both protocols allow data from the smartbox to be stored and easily monitored from a smartphone application or a computer web interface. MQTT is a good option in communications requiring very low bandwidth. However, there is a lack of suitable libraries to program alarm features for OPC UA Servers."
190,Evaluation of communication delay in IoT applications based on OPC UA,"The grow of Industry 4.0 is pushing the deployment of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) allowing many (all) industrial devices to be connected to the Internet for data sharing. Based on the enormous amount of data stored in the Cloud, new analysis algorithms can be run and the extracted information can be sold as â€œserviceâ€. Even if today the Industry 4.0 applications have still a slow reaction time, it is clear that â€œshort latency servicesâ€ may have competitive advantage in the market. For this reason, this paper is focused on the evaluation of the communication delay due to the transfer of data from the source (i.e. the production line) to the Cloud and the way back. The reference architecture considered in this paper is based on: the well accepted OPC UA (Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture) access method for retrieving data directly from the device inside the production line; and a classic gateway approach for sending data in real (commercial) Cloud platforms. In this paper a test methodology is proposed and a use case is presented to show its feasibility. The experimental outcomes demonstrate that, by means of the proposed methodology, flexible solutions based on OPC UA combined with industrial grade IoT gateways can be easily evaluated. From the perspective of the considered use case, the average delay due to communication from the production line (in details: from a Siemens S7 1500 controller) to the Cloud (IBM Bluemix platform) is less than 300 ms with a standard deviation of about 70 ms over two weeks observation time."
196,A Prefatory Study on Data Channelling Mechanism towards Industry 4.0,"Data are increasing in volume, variety and velocity in this Internet of things and big data era. It applies from industry (or manufacturing) process monitoring control to video surveillance analysis to track human and machines activities. Therefore, fast and accurate approaches in data channelling are needed to effectively deal with these big data. This paper presents practical methods to manage and transfer the data from industry manufacturing site to a centralized data processing hub. In this hub, data are transformed into understandable information, which can assist human in understanding and monitoring manufacturing situation autonomously. These data are collected and channelled to desired location for analysis through Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture (OPC UA). Industrial protocols and standards are used to interpret the data channelling methods and tested on several industrial machines. Result shows that size of data and number of OPC UA Client that connects to OPC Server affects the data channelling speed."
215,An Approach of Load Balancers for Low-cost CPPSs in Software-defined Networking Architecture,"Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS) and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) will improve the flexibility of the future production systems in the newest smart factories. In advanced manufacturing industries, a large number of machines, goods, control systems, and information systems will be interconnected. For this reason, it is necessary to implement load balancing technologies that improve responsiveness and increase the availability of applications, particularly when low-cost devices are used. This paper presents a novel architecture approach for load balancing using Software-Defined Networking (SDN). The proposal is based on IEC-61499 standard over OPC UA in industrial communications, and it is aimed at optimizing resources, maximizing throughput, minimizing response time, and avoiding overload in low-cost devices."
217,Towards a Real-Time Capable Plug & Produce Environment for Adaptable Factories,"Industrial manufacturing is currently undergoing a transformation from mass production with inflexible production systems to individual production with adaptable cells. In order to ensure this adaptability of these systems, technologies such as plug & produce are needed, to integrate, modify and remove devices at runtime. Therefor an exact description of the system, the products and the capabilities / skills of the devices is essential as well as a network for communication between the devices. Deterministic data transmission is particularly important for distributed control systems. We propose an architecture for plug & produce mechanisms with hard real-time capable communication paths between the cyber-physical components using OPC UA PubSub over TSN and the ability to load and execute real-time critical tasks at runtime."
235,Development of a Power Supply Control System and Virtual Simulation Based on Docker,"A proton therapy facility (HUST-PTF) based on a superconducting cyclotron is being developed by Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) and China Academy of Atomic Energy (CIAE). The beam transport system in this facility provides the required beam for the treatment rooms. The beamline control system (BCS) manages the operation of the degrader, beamline magnet power supplies (PS), diagnostics devices, etc. For additional security, BCS utilizes the OPC UA as the distributed control protocol. Since the PS controllers adopt a TCP communication protocol, an OPC UA server with TCP driver is developed as a gateway and front controller for PS control. In order to adapt fast beam-energy change, the ""list-trigger"" strategy is applied to the PS control. BCS downloads the respective current value lists to PS controllers before the treatment, and then triggers the PS controllers by pulse signals to alter the operation current to the next value in the list during the treatment. It is vital to decide when the current regulation process is complete in the transitional period, BCS should update the current values more frequent than the steady state. Therefore, the OPC UA server adopts the node dynamic refresh scheme. A virtual simulation based on docker followed by a thorough analysis are conducted on the PS control system, where the results show the node refresh time of the OPC UA server meets the PS control requirement. The virtual simulation is also proved to be cost-saving and reliable for control system tests and worth promoting."
240,A Real-time Computation Task Reconfiguration Mechanism for Industrial Edge Computing,"The growth of massive generated data from the industrial field results in performance reduction on network bandwidth, real-time response, and communication latency. For distributed industrial automation systems, edge computing suits better than cloud computing from real-time constraints purpose. Furthermore, the integration of OPC UA in edge computing nodes improves interoperability and compatibility. This paper focuses on computation task reconfiguration issues among physically neighboring nodes based on OPC UA. Considering the high real-time requirement in industrial edge computing, a task reconfiguration mechanism is proposed and a real-time workload reallocation algorithm for optimization without any iteration process. Finally, a case study on a triplex reciprocating pump with a multi-class faults simulation model proves that it can improve task execution efficiency without worsening classification accuracy much."
243,Experiences from Adjusting Industrial Software for Worst-Case Execution Time Analysis,"Worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis is a prevalent way to ensure the timely execution of programs in time-critical systems. With the advent of new technologies such as fog computing and time-sensitive networking (TSN), the interest in timing analysis has increased in industrial communication. This paper highlights experiences made while adjusting the publisher of the open62541 OPC UA stack to enable WCET analysis, following a simple process combined with the open-source platform T-CREST. The main challenges are the required knowledge about the code and the specific communication software characteristics like variable message sizes. Other findings indicate the need for other types of annotation for indirect recursion or callback functions. The paper provides the foundation for further research on adjusting the implementation of existing industrial communication protocols for WCET analysis."
248,A Comparative Study to Evaluate the Performance of Communication Protocols for Process Industry,"With the boom of Industry 4.0 for industrial automation, the data exchange between the different industrial devices has tremendously increased through local (edge) and cloud computing. Nowadays, several communication protocols are available to realize data acquisition in the industry. As a result, understanding the practical capabilities of each communication protocol arises as an essential issue in optimizing the data acquisition and storage in industrial plants. This study aims to develop a software-based test environment to evaluate the performance of two widely used communication protocols within the scope of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). These contemplated protocols are Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA) and Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT). With the help of the developed test environment, several performance metrics, like packet overhead, latency, packet loss ratio, and CPU utilization, are evaluated for different application scenarios where the varying number of clients and subscribers are considered. Derived results indicate the stronger parts of each protocol under varying communication configurations."
