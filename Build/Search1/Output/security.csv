9,Honeypot Inside an OPC UA Wrapper for Water Pumping Stations,"The honeypot technologies provided several research themes in the past years, primarily for detection and information gathering against external threats. The water infrastructure and generally automation/SCADA systems may be vulnerable to attacks. In case of critical infrastructures, the protection is necessary because an eventual successful attack can cause major damages. The paper presents a solution for protecting water pumping stations from threats using a honeypot inside an OPC UA wrapping structure. As known, Industry 4.0 and Industrial Internet of Things concepts are moving the industry towards interoperability and interoperation. OPC UA is the defined and widely accepted interfacing solution. The transition to OPC UA for both new and legacy systems can be realized through wrappers, such middleware protocol conversion and data wrapping structures are studied and developed. The proposed honeypot is conceived for Node-RED based applications being able to access Modbus, S7, OPC UA local structures and exposing tags in OPC UA server. The implemented structure was tested proving satisfactory results."
30,Secure Onboarding of IIoT Devices using OPC UA,"In todayâ€™s Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), a broad range of communication protocols are utilized. Built-in security mechanisms enable these protocols to protect communication and defend against network attacks. However, before IIoT devices can utilize these security mechanisms, they need to be securely onboarded in the network. Although several onboarding solutions exist, there is no widely applicable and easy solution for all protocols. Thus, owners of IIoT devices must currently perform multiple processes until they can securely use a device in operation, which requires a high amount of manual effort and onboarding infrastructure.In this work, we present a generic secure onboarding solution for a broad range of network protocols based on OPC UA. OPC UA is particularly suited for this task, as it is one of the most widespread IIoT protocols and one of few protocols whose standard defines a secure onboarding. Our solution leverages the OPC UA onboarding process to equip other IIoT protocols with the initial trust and credentials to establish secure connections. To this end, only minor extensions to the OPC UA implementation on devices are necessary, such that device owners can reuse their OPC UA onboarding infrastructure without any modifications. As a proof of concept for our solution, we demonstrate the secure onboarding of an HTTPS web server. Our implementation fully reuses the reference implementation OPC UA sample server as infrastructure and only needs minor extensions to the IIoT device."
32,Experimental Implementation of Remote Attestation over OPC UA Protocol,"We present design alternatives and a proof-of-concept demonstration realising the inclusion of remote attestation into Open Platform Communication - Unified Architecture (OPC UA), a modern Operational Technology (OT) protocol. This aspect is not yet covered by the OPC UA set of specifications. Remote attestation is about ascertaining the integrity of the software and the configuration of the attested devices, and is considered to be essential for safeguarding critical infrastructure. Remote attestation and OPC UA concepts are briefly summarized. We discuss alternatives for realising remote attestation over OPC UA, and, based on their relative merits, select one for experimentation. Related work is also discussed. Python-based proof-of-concept implementation was realised and experimented with for unearthing relevant issues that need to be resolved for actual OPC UA remote attestation. The findings are presented and the demonstrator is available as open source software as an example how to implement remote attestation over OPC UA protocol."
38,Open-Source OPC UA Security and Scalability,"OPC UA is widely adopted for remote-control in industrial environments. It has a central role for industrial control systems as it enables remote management. Compromising OPC UA can lead to compromising entire production facilities. Consequently, OPC UA requires a high level of security. Major commercial OPC UA implementations have compliance certificates ensuring that their security models obey the specification. However, open-source OPC UA implementations that have wide deployment mostly lack these certificates. In this work, we investigate the security models of the four most commonly used open-source implementations: open62541, node-opcua, UA-.NETStandard, and python-opcua. Furthermore, their scalabilities for the number of clients and OPC UA nodes are also analyzed."
47,Research on OPC UA Security Encryption Method,"With the continuous development of the internet, the existing risk coefficient in it is also rising. The original defense system has been unable to effectively resist the current risk. Illegal network monitoring, network intrusion attack, theft, tampering, network terrorism and other illegal criminal activities are flooding the whole network space in different degrees, which may bring security threats and economic losses to enterprises and individuals at any time. And with the development of industrial informatization, the data in the process of industrial production needs to be shared or users can see the production data at any time, so the security of data in the transmission process becomes a problem. At present, the OPC UA protocol is used by the devices in the factory when they interact with each other. This paper mainly studies the security status and communication efficiency of OPC UA. The communication efficiency here is mainly the encryption efficiency of the encryption algorithm, which improves the communication efficiency by improving the encryption efficiency."
86,Reasoning on Adopting OPC UA for an IoT-Enhanced Smart Energy System from a Security Perspective,"Smart Services using Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications are on the rise, but still more often than not, traditional industrial protocols are used to interconnect the entities of the resulting systems. These protocols are mostly not intended for functioning in such a highly interconnected environment and, therefore, often lack even the most fundamental security measures. To address this issue, this paper reasons on the security of a communications protocol, intended for Machine to machine (M2M) communications, namely the Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA) and exemplifies, on a smart energy system, its capability to serve as a secure communications architecture by either itself or in conjunction with traditional protocols."
103,Open Source OPC UA Data Traffic Characteristic and Anomaly Detection using Image-Encoding based Convolutional Neural Network,"The development of OT and IT technology and industrial growth requires the design of automation systems that can accommodate scalability and interoperability between devices. OPC UA is a communication protocol that bridges data exchange between devices using different communication platforms and protocols. OPC UA can also connect devices between levels in automation pyramids. As an open platform, open-source OPC UAs such as open62541, OpenOPCUA, and FreeOpcUa is currently being developed by several developer communities. Implementing open-source OPC UA is an attractive option if cost is a significant consideration. However, the primary purpose of implementing OPC UA is to communicate or exchange information effectively and reliably; information about the characteristics and performance of open-source OPC is needed before designing a particular open-source OPC-based automation system platform. This paper utilized FreeOpcUa, a Python OPC UA library, to determine communication traffic features between client and server and perform anomaly detection on the traffic. The results showed that when all clients read server data simultaneously, there was duplication (up to 9%) and loss (up to 5%) of some data packets. Otherwise, the server could read all clientsâ€™ transmitted data. Anomaly detection testing with an image-encoding CNN also showed promising results, with accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score values approaching one."
110,Portable Trust Anchor for OPC UA Using Auto-Configuration,"With increasing connectivity between industrial devices their attack surface grows. Consequently, secure setups have to allow these devices to distinguish trustworthy and untrustworthy communication partners. One of the most significant and wide-spread protocols for Ethernet-based data exchange between industrial devices and controls is the Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA). Although the OPC UA standard includes certificate-based security measures, it lacks of applicable solutions for bootstrapping trust. For secure communication, each OPC UA application is supposed to hold an application certificate which can be managed by a Global Discovery Server (GDS). Simply put, applications request their certificate from the GDS as well as information about trustworthy and revoked certificates of third parties. However, the OPC UA specifications do not suggest a secure method to establish the initial trust for the communication between an application and the GDS. Moreover, in current implementations, the administrator has to manually interchange the certificates between the peers to build sufficient trust relationships. This paper proposes an evaluated portable trust-anchor-based concept to establish this initial trust and demonstrates it solely based on standardized OPC UA communication."
123,PKI and User Access Rights Management for OPC UA based Applications,"The growing need for end-to-end security in distributed communication for industrial automation as emphasized in Industrie 4.0 requires an investigation of the security features of relevant protocols. One of the security requirements is authentication and authorization of users within and across organizational boundaries. OPC UA (Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture) is a service-oriented architecture for platform independent communication in automation industry. This research work is on OPC UA to understand its security architecture's support for end-to-end communication and an implementation of a demo PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) to illustrate the same. The design and implementation of such a PKI facilitates both, offline and online validation services. This work emphasizes different concepts of PKIs used in enabling security in applications based on OPC UA standards. The information modelling provided by OPC UA has options to enable user access rights. The applicability of access level attributes in differentiating access rights between different users is demonstrated. The results of this work illustrate a single level hierarchical trust model for end-to-end communication using X509IdentityToken authentication for a user to access services provided by an OPC UA server. The demonstration of online validation for X.509 certificate using OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) protocol is illustrated. The offline validation using CRL (Certificate Revocation List) is also illustrated. The X.509 certificates required for OPC UA based applications can be generated using a tool called keytool. A open source project of keytool is used to create the OPC UA specific extensions for the certificates. There are several challenges in implementing such an infrastructure for distributed systems and they are described. The scope for further research is discussed briefly."
125,Development of a monitoring system for encrypted data by OPC UA,"Cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure have been on the rise. Therefore, cyber-security has become very important for Industrial Control Systems (ICS). For communication protocol in ICS networks, the Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA) communication protocol, which enables secure and platform-independent communications, is expected to be widely used. Beginning from OPC UA v1.04, which was released in 2021, Pub/Sub mode has been supported in addition to Client/Server. Because it can easily support much more communications than usual, it can support all use cases in the industrial sector. An important property of OPC UA is encryption. It is effective in protecting communication data from tampering and eavesdropping but also makes it impossible to monitor communications. In ICS, ill commands to controllers can cause dangerous situations. Even a secure communication protocol cannot guarantee that the data being communicated are safe. There are many types of machines, such as operating support systems and engineering workstations, that can send commands to controllers. They are implemented in common operating systems and may fall victim to a cyber-attack. Therefore, the commands to controllers should be monitored. We propose a monitoring system for encrypted data by OPC UA."
153,Secure Provisioning of OPC UA Applications Using the Asset Administration Shell,"Modern Industry 4.0 environments are highly interconnected and have therefore an increased need for security. Protocols for machine-to-machine communication, like OPC UA, can provide this security. However, before using their security mechanisms, a trust relationship between the application and operator network first needs to be established. This trust and key exchange is performed during secure provisioning, a process often performed manually and without security in mind. In OPC UA, there are already automated provisioning mechanisms planned and partly existing, but they either involve high manual effort or cannot provide mutual authentication between application and operator network. The Asset Administration Shell (AAS), as a realization of the digital twin concept, already provides the possibility of a secured data and information exchange between manufacturer and operator. In this work, we combine the security mechanisms of OPC UA and AAS to provide a more secure and automated provisioning of new OPC UA applications."
159,Hybrid OPC UA: Enabling Post-Quantum Security for the Industrial Internet of Things,"Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are considered a crucial part for providing connectivity in industrial environments. However, the recent increase in connectivity has led to an extended attack vector. Therefore, it is important that CPS are secured against current and â€” due to their long life span â€” also against future threats, such as quantum computers. The security of present communication can be broken once a sufficiently powerful quantum computer is available. To protect against this attack vector, applications and protocols should start utilizing quantum-resistant primitives. One approach that maintains common security guarantees and protects against quantum computer attacks is to use hybrid constructions: a combination of classically secure and quantum-resistant schemes. In this work, we propose a hybrid key exchange mechanism for the industrial communication protocol Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA). We describe four distinct instantiations based on selected quantum-resistant key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs), namely NewHope, NTRU, CRYSTALS-Kyber, and Saber. We implement our resulting quantum-resistant modifications of OPC UA on two different ARM based platforms and present detailed performance footprints. Finally, we show the feasibility of employing hybrid quantum-resistant key exchange within OPC UA preserving industrial communication against future threats."
173,Interoperability of OPC UA PubSub with Existing Message Broker Integration Architectures,"Interoperable communication technologies are of key importance in production systems with increasing needs for data in their adoption of data-driven methodologies and new, emerging applications. OPC UA PubSub defines an alternative to the traditional client-server communication with a publish-subscribe model for data to cater to scalability and data-driven cloud application needs. In this paper, the OPC UA PubSub model is compared to some other message broker and communication technologies and integrated with an existing message based integration model for evaluating the interoperability. A case example is presented where data payloads and information security practices are integrated using an adapter approach."
174,On the Security of IIoT Deployments: An Investigation of Secure Provisioning Solutions for OPC UA,"A key technology for the communication in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is the Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA). OPC UA is a standard that enables interoperable, secure, and reliable communication between industrial devices. To defend against cyber attacks, OPC UA has built-in security mechanisms that protect the authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of data in transit. Before communicating securely, it is essential that OPC UA devices are set up in a secure manner. This process is referred to as secure provisioning. An improper provisioning can lead to weak or insecure OPC UA deployments that enable adversaries to eavesdrop or even manipulate communication between industrial devices. Such insecure deployments can also be maliciously provoked by adversaries who tamper with insecure provisioning solutions. Despite secure provisioning is essential for OPC UA security and usability, there exists no overview and systematic analysis on the patchwork of different solutions in industry and academia. This article presents the first investigation of secure device provisioning solutions for the OPC UA communication protocol. First, desired objectives and evaluation criteria for secure provisioning of OPC UA devices are defined. Next, existing and emerging OPC UA provisioning solutions are analyzed and compared based on the elaborated objectives and criteria. Additionally, an outlook into the future of OPC UA provisioning is given, based on solutions from the IoT domain. Finally, the analyzed OPC UA secure provisioning solutions are compared, recommendations are given, and research gaps are identified. It is shown that contemporary provisioning solutions offer an insufficient level of security. Emerging and future solutions provide much higher security guarantees but impose a tradeoff between usability and requirements on devices and infrastructures."
193,"Simplifying functional safety communication in modular, heterogeneous production lines","Heterogeneous production lines as a keystone of smart factories, comprised of machines from various manufacturers, are placing a new range of demands on communication and interoperability. Connectivity is the key element for seamless data communication in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). This includes standardized protocols and interfaces as well as vendor neutral technologies. An important aspect of a production line, is functional safety and its technical implementation. Up to now, safety-relevant connections between devices of different manufacturers have been implemented using dedicated cables and line monitoring. The aim of this paper is to design an integrated safety architecture based upon existing technologies. The method proposed in this paper aims at achieving functional safety connectivity, along with non-safe data traffic, based on the vendor-neutral technologies Ethernet, Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN), and OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA)."
222,Design and Application of Cloud Platform Based on OpenStack in Remote Online Collection and Monitoring System of Intelligent Workshop,"With the development of information technology, network technology, Internet technology, cloud computing technology and so on are more and more widely used in various industries. The traditional industrial automation hierarchy structure is complex and the integration degree is not high. It can not meet the development needs of informationization and intelligence, and is limited by the site infrastructure. Therefore, this paper designs a remote online acquisition and monitoring system architecture for intelligent workshop based on OpenStack private cloud computing, which completes the functions of data acquisition, online monitoring, database management and real-time control. In addition, this paper also considers the characteristics of the system architecture, such as filing, disaster tolerance and security. Using OPC UA protocol and Modbus RTU protocol to complete data acquisition, data interaction between the bottom of the factory and the bottom of the enterprise. At the same time, cloud computing data center centralized storage and management of the collected data, which provides great convenience for the follow-up analysis of large data in the workshop, and has a certain practical value."
229,Cyber Security Risks of Technical Components in Industry 4.0,"Industry 4.0 is a new concept of automation data exchange in manufacturing. Industry 4.0 consists of various technical components such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), IoT, OPC UA, and cloud. There could be cyber risks when these technical components are used in Industrial Control System (ICS) without security consideration. Therefore cyber risk assessment, reconsideration of implementation, operation are necessary to adopt Industry 4.0. Problems of previous research for ICS risk assessments are some of them are theoretical and conceptual methods such as simulations. Moreover, they do not focus on Industry 4.0 components.The objective of this research is to prove the concrete cyber risks and introduces corresponding secure implementations for Industry 4.0 components such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA). The proposed method has benefits for clarifying impacts on the real world by cyber-attacks through penetration tests against ICS testbed with actual machines."
237,A Unified Architecture for Industrial IoT Security Requirements in Open Platform Communications,"We present a unified communication architecture for security requirements in the industrial internet of things. Formulating security requirements in the language of OPC UA provides a unified method to communicate and compare security requirements within a heavily heterogeneous landscape of machines in the field. Our machine-readable data model provides a fully automatable approach for security requirement communication within the rapidly evolving fourth industrial revolution, which is characterized by high-grade interconnection of industrial infrastructures and self-configuring production systems. Capturing security requirements in an OPC UA compliant and unified data model for industrial control systems enables strong use cases within modern production plants and future supply chains. We implement our data model as well as an OPC UA server that operates on this model to show the feasibility of our approach. Further, we deploy and evaluate our framework within a reference project realized by 14 industrial partners and 7 research facilities within Germany."
245,An Industrial Marketplace - the Smart Factory Web Approach and Integration of the International Data Space,"Smart Factory Web is a platform for smart factories to enable flexible sharing and management of assets and resources to maximize efficiency and provide visibility on a global market. To join the Smart Factory Web, participants describe their factory capabilities, which are modelled in an ontology. AutomationML is used to assist with this modelling. OPC UA is used as a communication protocol for factory live-data from the machines. However, factory owners are hesitant to share critical production data. Therefore, the communication has to be secure and in the best case, provide control mechanisms for the data owners. The International Data Space is a peer-to-peer network that will support secure exchange of data and data usage control. In this paper, the Smart Factory Web approach is discussed and extended by an implementation with the current state of the International Data Space."
252,Application Study of Hardware-Based Security for Future Industrial IoT,"The stepwise evolution of conventional production facilities into future Smart Factory or Industrial IoT paradigms entails special requirements on future industrial devices and communication networks. Due to the considerably increasing demand of interconnected devices - for internal and even external remote access - various security measures of future industrial equipment must be improved. Therefore, this paper presents an application-and feasibility study of secured communication between today's and future stationary industrial devices - based on the upcoming OPC UA protocol and partially enhanced with hardware-based security."
258,Design of Multi-Protocol Industrial Ethernet Security Monitor,"Aiming at the information security in industrial communication network and industrial network integration requirements, this paper develops in-depth study on the current industrial ethernet, OPC UA, Modbus TCP and Profinet, against the vulnerability in the industrial control network, adopts the security strategy under the combination of security function in the mainstream industrial ethernet and protocol deep analysis, and designs an ethernet security monitor in multi-protocol industry. This monitor is able to identify different network protocols automatically in single or multiple network protocols, maintain surveillance over network status in real-time according to the security configuration strategy, supervise illegal access from unauthorized devices, abnormal message, network abnormalities, etc., track the equipment critical process data, and realize local and remote alarm function. After testing, this monitor does not affect the original industrial control network and can effectively protect the security of industrial control network."
267,Flexible Safety Systems for Smart Manufacturing,"Smart manufacturing is realizing the idea and potential of Industry 4.0 in reality. An essential part of smart manufacturing are production facilities that dynamically adapt to changing production needs. This brings completely new challenges to functional safety systems, which are mandatory for the protection of man, machine, and environment. Currently, functional safety systems are designed and certified in a static way. The safety design and the configuration are derived from the risk assessment which is performed during the design of a machine. Once the system is put into operation, the safety configuration is not changed anymore. This approach constitutes an impediment to flexibility which smart manufacturing production facilities require nowadays.This paper proposes the design of a self-organizing safety system with the objective to assist an engineer who operates a smart manufacturing facility by discovering all safety-related devices and generating automatically a suitable safety configuration. This configuration will be deployed to the system automatically after adaptation and validation by the safety engineer. The proposed self-organizing safety system, simplifies the safety configuration in a dynamically changing environment. Consequently, it would reduce engineering efforts and decrease machine downtime which improves profitability."
270,Rent'n'Produce: A Secure Cloud Manufacturing Platform for Small and Medium Enterprises,"The manufacturing landscape is subject to change due to current trends as digitalization, the industrial internet of things and cloud manufacturing. Especially the cloud manufacturing paradigm does effect job order production and contract manufacturing. While these paradigm does simplify communication between contractors security and privacy issues have been identified as one of the biggest obstacles in prior research. Within this paper this obstacle is targeted; a platform to close this gap is outlined."
290,Attack Detection in Cyber-Physical Production Systems using the Deterministic Dendritic Cell Algorithm,"Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS) are key enablers for industrial and economic growth. The introduction of the Internet of Things (IoT) in industrial processes represents a new revolution towards the Smart Manufacturing oncept and is usually designated as the 4th Industrial Revolution. Despite the huge interest from the industry to innovate their production systems, in order to increase revenues at lower costs, the IoT concept is still immature and fuzzy, which increases security related risks in industrial systems. Facing this paradigm and, since CPPS have reached a level of complexity, where the human intervention for operation and control is becoming increasingly difficult, Smart Factories require autonomic methodologies for security management and self-healing. This paper presents an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) approach for CPPS, based on the deterministic Dendritic Cell Algorithm (dDCA). To evaluate the dDCA effectiveness, a testing dataset was generated, by implementing and injecting various attacks on a OPC UA based CPPS testbed. The results show that these attacks can be successfully detected using the dDCA."
291,The Industrie 4.0 Asset Administration Shell as Information Source for Security Analysis,"One of the essential concepts of the Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI4.0) is the uniform modelling of assets by means of a common meta-data model called the Asset Administration Shell (AAS). However, important practical experience with this concept is still missing, as not many use cases for the AAS have yet been implemented. Thus, practical issues within the AAS concept and respective solutions are hard to identify. In this paper, presents our experience with the implementation of an AAS use case. The AAS is used as information source to create an ontology, which is then used for security analysis. The paper discusses the use-case-specific modelling language selection and provides a practical examination of several of our implementations that use OWL and OPC UA together. Furthermore, it provides recommendations for the implementation of Asset Administration Shells for this and similar use cases."
