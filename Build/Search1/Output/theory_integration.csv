7,OPC UA server on Raspberry Pi and Arduino for didactic use,"In the market there are different alternatives in communication protocols, but most of them turn out to be specific to technology providers, thus making the implementation of the OPC UA protocol mean the possibility of eliminating proprietary barriers and making production processes more efficient. That is why in this work a didactic and affordable OPC UA system mounted on a Raspberry Pi is proposed that allows the writing and reading of data for the control of the ranges and operating states of actuators and sensors, thus allowing to introduce young university students to what is an environment of Industry 4.0 and the Internet of Things (IoT) so that in their professional future they achieve a rapid adaptation to the productive sector."
8,OPC UA Information Modeling Method and Xml Definition,"Through the different nodes in the address space of OPC UA Server, different OPC UA Clients can get a data set full of information, which includes variables, objects, methods, events and types. Customized data types can also be defined in the set. OPC UA Clients need to access the relevant type definition first, which describes the information structure and the encoding rules of the nodes they want to access. So, it's important to define a vendor specific type for a resource-constrained device server, and try to simplify the Complex data model. This article describes the basic structure of the standard OPC UA Address Space, which nodes are mandatory and which are optional in the UA Server. It proposes the principal of building a vendor UA Server, and introduce the open source tool UA-Model Compiler, which can help vendor to customize the minimal namespace0 contained in the UA Server."
12,Mapping OPC UA AddressSpace to OCF resource model,"The paper presents a proposal to map OPC UA AddressSpace into Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) Resource Model. The mapping is based on the ad-hoc definition of an OCF Device and OCF Resources, each of which models an OPC UA Node of an OPC UA AddressSpace. The proposal represents a first step to enable interoperability between OPC UA and OCF specifications, allowing an OCF Client to access information maintained by an OPC UA Server. The proposal is original as current literature does not provide for such kind of integration."

14,Querying OPC UA information models with SPARQL,"OPC UA is one of the most important communication protocols for IIoT applications in the automation domain. One important requirement for Industry 4.0 scenarios is standardized semantics, which is introduced into OPC UA through Companion Specifications. Nevertheless, OPC UA still lacks a comfortable interface for accessing these huge graphs, especially on the edge- and cloud-layer. Of course, there is a query language specified for OPC UA. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no publicly available implementation.In this paper, we will present how SPARQL can be used to query OPC UA graphs natively and also will present rules to transform OPC UA queries into SPARQL queries. Furthermore, we will highlight some issues of OPC UA Query and how they can be bypassed by native SPARQL. Finally, we were able to correctly execute all nine example queries of OPC UA Part 4 Annex B (complex examples) with both approaches."
15,A CoAP-based OPC UA Transmission Scheme for Resource-Constrained Devices,"The Industrial Internet continuously covers all aspects of smart manufacturing. As an enabling technology for Industrial Internet, OPC UA protocol realizes the information modeling and unified description of industry devices. Furthermore, OPC UA supports data access through Web services based on HTTP. However, the high resource cost of HTTP for resource-constrained devices is hard to afford. The CoAP protocol is specially designed for resource-constrained devices, and it has better suitability in the IoT environment than HTTP. Therefore, an efficient and lightweight transmission scheme, which is applied to realize the transfer of OPC UA messages over the CoAP protocol, is proposed in this paper. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme realizes the effective transmission of resource-constrained device data through the Web service interface via OPC UA."
18,VSOMEIP - OPC UA Gateway Solution for the Automotive Industry,"The fourth industrial revolution is relying on interoperability and consequently on the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) concept. The industry is constantly researching and developing solutions for vertical and horizontal interoperation of systems, some concepts being already well-grounded. One of the main issues is the interfacing. The industry accepted the OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) protocol as of high importance for interoperability in the IIoT context. The automotive industry is considered to have a separate path, because of a somehow more rigid approach towards communication and data integration. But, car-to-infrastructure and even car-to-car communication are requiring data exchange and implicitly a newer approach from the automotive industry. Recently, VSOMEIP (Scalable service Oriented MiddlewarE over IP from Genivi) interfacing is more and more present in automotive, its main focus being to assure interoperation between the Electronic Control Units (ECUs). The current paper proposes a VSOMEIP - OPC UA gateway conceptual solution that assures car interfacing in the IIoT context. The proof of concept is implemented regarding AUTOSAR (Automotive Open System Architecture) requirements, using a tailored operating system on an embedded device. In the first case study, the gateway is tested having all OPC UA and VSOMEIP clients and servers implemented and functioning on the device. The second case study presents the connection to an external OPC UA server. The obtained results are proving the effectiveness of the concept."
21,Extended gateway model for OPC UA/IoT device integration,"In the paper, we share our research results and experiences with the industrial integration of IoT devices and OPC UA systems, assuming it is one of major enablers for Industry 4.0 use-cases. The main focus is paid on the numerical model of integration gateway, which could enable integration of various IoT devices, embedded and constrained systems, where implementation of full-scale OPC UA protocol is not possible. The goal is to create the appropriate model for OPC UA/IoT device integrations, verify and test it with implemented integration gateway. The gateway implementation scope and testing was concentrated on OPC DA and two major IoT protocols: MQTT and COAP."
24,Collecting Data from Variable Kinematic Machine Tools with OPC UA Protocol,"The article deals with the issues of data collection from technological equipment, the kinematics of which change dynamically during the execution of the control program. The structural model is considered and the hierarchical levels of obtaining data from the CNC system using the OPC UA protocol are highlighted on the example of a milling machine. An extension of the information model OPC UA data for the control of machines with dynamic kinematics is proposed. A generalized information model of OPC-UA data has been built with highlighted common and variable components. Implemented a mechanism for obtaining data on the client side when switching the kinematic scheme from using the â€œPublisher-Subscriberâ€ model"
29,Communication interface specification in OPC UA,"Due to its modeling capabilities, platform independence, and extendability, Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA) is considered to be the main candidate for a so-called â€œenabling technology for industry 4.0â€. However, the engineering effort for OPC UA applications, in particular the server, is very high as the process of information modeling and linking the resulting model to real-world data is complex and time-consuming. This significantly limits the spread of OPC UA in manufacturing and other domains.This paper presents an approach towards extending OPC UA in a way such that information necessary for the OPC UA server application to access the underlying system can be specified in the information model. This is achieved by defining communication interfaces for all nodes of the information model that represent readable or writable data. The handling of the interfaces needs to be implemented in code only once and from then on they can be modeled, rather than implemented for each node individually. Thus, the implementation effort of OPC UA servers is reduced. Different modeling approaches for communication interfaces are presented and compared."
31,Research on Key Technologies of OPC UA Standard and Test,"OPC UA has been widely applied in the interconnection and interoperability of industrial Internet and intelligent manufacturing, the standards are the criterion of OPC UA technology, the address space is the basis for realizing OPC UA, the information model is the core feature of OPC UA. The quality of developed products must be ensured after passing the test and certification. The key Technologies of OPC UA which showing in this papers will guide development and application of OPC UA."
33,Towards an Industrial Converged Network with OPC UA PubSub and TSN,"Technologies such as TSN and OPC UA are enablers for converged networks in industrial applications. TSN enables the coexistence of network traffic with real-time requirements and best-effort requirements. On the other hand, OPC UA defines a common information model in addition to secure communication, scalability, and platform independence. The new specification of OPC UA PubSub enables the possibility of implementing OPC UA on the lower levels of the automation pyramid, the field level. Therefore, combining these two technologies can in principle be implemented for every vertical and horizontal communication. This document analyzes the state of the art of OPC UA over TSN and explains the first steps towards an easy to use proof-of-concept for a converged network that is also designed to be a testbed. The testbed will be used to evaluate the interoperability of TSN-capable devices from different vendors. In addition to that, different OPC UA PubSub implementations will be used and benchmarked. These future results will present an overview of the currently available products and provides hands-on experiences for practical implementations of converged networks."
34,Overview of OPC UA TSN,"Ethernet has become a very extensive communication protocol standard for the intercommunication and connection of enterprises, homes and even data center networks. However, with the rapid development of network technology and the expansion of vertical industry applications, at the data transmission level, there will be higher requirements for the certainty, real-time, and reliability of network transmission. The traditional Ethernet channel access method is based on competition, and cannot meet the real-time requirements of various industries. The OPC UA TSN combination emerges spontaneously. The communication network provided by this combination is not only highly deterministic and real-time, but more importantly, it realizes the true independence of the communication network from equipment manufacturers, in terms of network security, bandwidth, interoperability, synchronization, and delay. It has brought huge improvements. It has to be said that the OPC UA TSN combination is the best partner for establishing a comprehensive network between the sensor and the cloud."
36,On automatic generation of OPC UA connections in IEC 61499 automation systems,"Demand for customization and the need to adapt to rapidly changing global markets have increased the demand for digitalization and intelligent manufacturing. Unlike traditional factories, smart factories aim for high digitalization and efficiency of IT technology adoption. The digital twin is a major enabler of the smart factory. Digital twin provides virtual models, cloud services and data connections among real and virtual components. The engineered kinematics of virtual models must dynamically behave like physical elements. This paper proposes an algorithm and implements the software tool for the automatic generation of OPC UA connections between the IEC 61499-based control application and the OPC UA server. The main contribution is that virtual models can easily and quickly subscribe to published Input/Output (I/O) variables via OPC UA standard."
39,Implementation and Performance Analysis of Power and Cost-Reduced OPC UA Gateway for Industrial IoT Platforms,"OPC UA is an international standard for smart factories that defines communication technologies and data processing methods. Therefore, OPC UA supports high interoperability among various protocols and plays an important role in building Smart Factory. However, changing a factory using a variety of existing devices and protocols to a device using a single protocol is, in reality, a barrier to entry due to the enormous cost and lack of experimentation. Therefore, this paper proposes OPC UA gateway that can accommodate OPC UA specification in industrial device platform based on ARM processor. Evaluate performance based on indicators such as publication interval, sampling interval, subscription limit, encryption and security guidelines. Our experimental results show that operating costs are reduced by about 66% compared to x86 processors. It also provides a way to reduce costs over older systems by connecting Microsoft's Azure IoT cloud."
40,OPC UA Information Model and a Wrapper for IEC 61499 Runtimes,"OPC UA is considered as an important communication technology for Industry 4.0 components. On the other hand, IEC 61499 is one of the technologies available for developing applications to the same components. In this paper, a proposal for an OPC UA information model for IEC 61499 systems is developed in order to enhance communication with IEC 61499 applications through OPC UA. Already existing related information models, particularly OPC UA for Devices and IEC 61131-3, are utilized as models and parts of the design. An OPC UA wrapper for IEC 61499 runtimes is presented as one possible way to implement the information model. Both the information model and the wrapper are then tested through a case study."
41,Research and application of OPC UA server based on resource constrained platform STM32,"In view of the rapid development trend of intelligent manufacturing and the application status of OPC UA protocol in the field of intelligent manufacturing, the requirement of building OPC UA server on resource constrained platform is proposed. By building STM32 platform and FreeRTOS system environment, the transplantation and operation of OPC UA protocol stack in resource limited platform are realized, the main memory space occupied by OPC UA protocol stack is analyzed, and the implementation path is proposed for later optimization. Through experimental verification, the OPC UA protocol stack runs on the resource limited platform, and the server can be widely used and popularized in the resource limited platform."
42,Transforming OPC UA Information Models into Domain-Specific Ontologies,"Semantics interoperability is important for cyber-physical systems to enable complex data processing and facilitating interworking. OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) provides an extensible information model but lacks formal semantics. Ontologies based on the Web Ontology Language (OWL) can provide such formal semantics. Thus, we present a transformation approach that converts OPC UA information models (or only parts of them) into domain-specific ontologies. The transformation process consists of two steps. The first step is a mapping from OPC UA to OWL Full. The second step performs a graph transformation, based on SPARQL rules, into the domain-specified target ontology. The adaption of this transformation to the source information model and the target ontology can be accomplished by only adapting these transformation rules. The presented approach is evaluated for a use case of an industrial heating process to show its flexibility."
43,TSN Traffic Shaping for OPC UA Field Devices,"This paper extends research on TSN enablement for OPC UA field devices, comparing the impact of credit-based and time-aware traffic shapers. Despite conceptual difference, these traffic shaping methods can provide similar bandwidth reservation for high priority traffic. The two shapers are superposed with varying traffic limitations to assess the timing characteristics of the OPC UA data exchange using a resource-constrained field device."
44,A proposal to make OCF and OPC UA interoperable,The paper presents a mapping between the Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) Resource Model and the OPC UA Information Model. The mapping may allow to enable the interoperability between the OCF and OPC UA specifications. The proposal is original as current literature does not provide for such kind of integration.
53,Enabling Plug&Play Cyber-Physical Systems Using Knowledge-Driven OPC UA Discovery,"Industrial automation domain is changing rapidly in recent years. It is very important in the involvement of technologies such as Cyber-Physical Systems. They are based on interoperable devices. On the other hand, it is difficult to find a suitable format and mechanism for successful communication of devices. One of the important requirements is to find a specific device as a demanded counterpart for communication. In this paper, we will show that the integration of OPC UA standard and Semantic Web technologies provides an interesting solution."
54,Towards Performance Benchmarking of Cyclic OPC UA PubSub over TSN,"PubSub is a recent introduction to a widely-accepted industrial communication protocol OPC UA. It is driven by OPC Foundation Field eXchange group (ex-FLC, ex-Shapers) to enable real-time OPC UA over TSN for cyclic communication in industrial automation. Furthermore, evolution of Soft Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) to Virtual PLCs entails a wider use of software stacks and applications expected to provide necessary level of performance, which might be influenced by various configuration options of the application, the OPC UA stack, and the underlying operating system. In this work we address this issue with an experimental setup for benchmarking of cyclic PubSub applications using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and a state-of-the-art open-source OPC UA PubSub stack. Experimental results show achievable jitter and cycle times for different message sizes, SDK options, and OS configurations."
55,Reasoning over OPC UA Information Models using Graph Embedding and Reinforcement Learning,"With the fourth industrial revolution, the OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) has emerged as the standard communication framework for the implementation of cyber-physical production systems since it can be used for both, communication and information modeling. Even though OPC UA helps bridge the interoperability gap at the automation level, its semantic has not yet been formally defined and generated or manually created OPC UA information models are often incomplete and inconsistent making an efficient automated reasoning and knowledge inference on the OPC UA address space particularly challenging.In this paper, we show that it is possible to train a machine learning system on OPC UA information models, such that it performs automated reasoning over OPC UA knowledge graphs with high precision and recall. More specifically, we present a reinforcement learning based solution that learns to reason on semantically incomplete OPC UA information models by constructing multi-hop relational paths along an embedded vector space of the knowledge graph representing the information model. The construction of such relational paths allows the discovery of missing relations between the entities and at the same time the evaluation of the truth of the encoded triples, thus enabling consistency checks and questions answering."
57,Hardware Implementation of an OPC UA Server for Industrial Field Devices,"Industrial plants suffer from a high degree of complexity and incompatibility in their communication infrastructure, caused by a wild mix of proprietary technologies. This prevents transformation toward Industry 4.0 and the Industrial Internet of Things. Open platform communications unified architecture (OPC UA) is a standardized protocol that addresses these problems with uniform and semantic communication across all levels of the hierarchy. However, its adoption in embedded field devices, such as sensors and actuators, is still lacking due to prohibitive memory and power requirements of software implementations. We have developed a dedicated hardware engine that offloads processing of the OPC UA protocol and enables the realization of compact and low-power field devices with OPC UA support. As part of a proof-of-concept embedded system, we have implemented this engine in a 22-nm FDSOI technology, representing the first ASIC implementation of an OPC UA server. We measured performance, power consumption, and memory footprint of our test chip and compared it with a software implementation based on open62541 and a Raspberry Pi 2B. Our OPC UA hardware engine is 50 times more energy efficient and only requires 36 KiB of memory. The complete system consumes only 24 mW under full load, making it suitable for low-power embedded applications."
59,Design and Implementation of OPC UA Server Based on SECS/GEM Protocol,"In order to solve the problem of incompatibility of communication data between semiconductor manufacturing industry and other automation industries, a design scheme of OPC UA server development based on SEMI Equipment Communications Standard/Generic Model for Communications (SECS/GEM) was proposed. The design idea and workflow of the whole system are described in detail. After testing, the server has completed real-time communication with the third-party SECS/GEM equipment simulation software and UA client, and solved the problem that the data message in the communication process of semiconductor equipment is not compatible with OPC UA specification."
62,A Smart Gateway Enabling OPC UA and DDS Interoperability,"Interoperability is one of the major challenges of adoption of the Industrial Internet of Things. OPC UA is one of the main industrial standards for the Request-reply messaging pattern, and DDS is one of the main industrial standards for the Publish-subscribe messaging pattern. How to ensure data is communicated, understandable, and interoperable between the systems implemented by OPC UA and DDS is an industrial concern to address. This study proposes a novel middleware solution which enables effective communication between these two message patterns. We evaluate our work by testing the middleware's performance on a scenario using a Raspberry Pi and the software middleware connected to a private LAN, measuring response times and reliability."
67,Introduction of Group-Subscriptions for RESTful OPC UA clients in IIoT environments,"In the automation domain, OPC UA can be considered one of the most important communication protocols for IIoT applications. According to a study of McKinsey the potential economic impact of the IoT within factories may reach up to 3,7 Trillion Dollar by 2025. To unlock this potential it is very important to bridge the interoperability gap. Since V1.04 OPC UA also supports session-less clients and therefore allows the development of RESTful clients which can be used to address the cross-domain interoperability issue. However, currently, RESTful clients cannot use Subscriptions, because the corresponding Service Sets are not supported for session-less clients. In this paper, we will present how Subscriptions can be introduced for session-less clients. Furthermore, we outline how Group-Subscriptions can be introduced for session-less as well as session-based clients. Finally, our evaluation shows that Group-Subscriptions significantly outperform standard Subscriptions if the Subscription can be shared by several clients."
69,Deterministic Communication Based on TSN and OPC UA Embedded Server,"With the development trend of industry 4.0 and intelligent manufacturing, industrial automation systems will tend to be unified and standardized solutions. Based on meeting the industrial communication requirements, the data access, function realization, and so on in the industrial system are required to be unified as far as possible. At present, a more mature solution is the combination of TSN and OPC UA, which is expected to simplify the integration and management of complex multi-vendor automation systems. This paper studies one aspect, the standardized and deterministic access to industrial field data based on TSN and OPC UA embedded server."
70,Integration of Smart Vision Sensor into Manipulator Control System using OPC-UA,"High product variety imposed to manufacturing companies by contemporary market requires efficient adaptation of production, which leads to the application of Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems (RMS). These systems are based on rapid and effective reconfiguration of manufacturing equipment that can be achieved only through high-level interoperability of the multi-vendor devices. OPC-UA (Open Platform Communication - Unified Architecture) as a platform-independent standard provides semantic interoperability and secure machine to machine communication and represents a basis for RMS development. In this paper, we illustrate how OPC-UA can be employed for integration of smart devices into legacy control system using an example of electropneumatic manipulation system and smart vision sensor. The smart vision sensor consists of a camera augmented by RaspberryPi platform that utilizes an image classification method based on convolutional neural networks (CNN)."
72,OPC UA based IEC 61499 Device Configuration Interface,"In the modern era of industrial automation, the term Industry 4.0 is defined as the fourth industrial revolution. This is a phenomenon where technologies from various layers of an enterprise are interconnected and form a meshed network of self-regulated, adaptive, re-configurable and self-optimizing devices. These devices vary from Programmable Logic Controller, embedded PCs, edge nodes, smart sensors, and actuators, working as proxies or mediators for a real object in the software domain integrating into Intelligent Enterprise Applications. Heterogeneous configuration interfaces of these devices hinder smooth integration and configuration process. A unified way of interacting with the devices for configuration is well-defined in the IEC 61499 standard. The standard defines the commands, interaction behavior, and interface description for the control devices and engineering tools. There are implementations of the configuration interface in XML and Binary XML, which are widely used for their flexible, extensible, and human-readable nature. Whereas the OPC UA can offer an open configuration interface for the IEC 61499 devices and software tools, with built-in interoperability solutions. This paper introduces the concept of a new configuration interface for the IEC 61499 devices using OPC UA information modeling concepts."
73,Interoperability Between ROS and OPC UA: A Local Cloud-Based Approach,"Today's manufacturing industries use a large suite of protocols and technologies to operate heterogeneous devices and software modules. Some of the most widely used technologies in industrial production are OPC UA (Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture) and ROS (Robot Operating System). Hence, enabling interoperability across these technologies is critical to ensure a smooth production flow. We propose a local cloud-based approach to achieve interoperability between ROS and OPC UA by integrating them with the Eclipse Arrowhead Framework. This integration allows these technologies to operate as independent systems while communicating securely at runtime. In addition to achieving interoperability, this integration supports important industrial aspects such as loose coupling, late binding, and cyber-security, making it a flexible solution."
74,A formal mapping between OPC UA and the Semantic Web,"The communication protocol OPC UA is one of the most important IIoT enablers within the automation domain. OPC UA not only aims to provide interoperability on the transport layer, but also interoperability of the semantic layer shall be addressed based on so-called Companion Specifications. However, the lack of OPC UA formal semantics makes automatic validation of OPC UA data models impossible. Another drawback is the shortage of available tools for OPC UA, such as an implementation of the query engine for the specified OPC UA query language. In this paper we provide a formal translation of OPC UA models to the Semantic Web standard OWL, thus making OPC UA implicit semantics, that is described in the documentation, explicit, by means of OWL axioms. Moreover, we outline how this mapping can be used to offer validation and querying of OPC UA data models based on already existing Semantic Web technology."
80,Plug&Produce Integration of Components into OPC UA based data-space,"Current manufacturing and production systems are becoming more flexible and adaptable. Such systems demand rapid changeover and short configuration time of machines. With the adaptation of IT systems in the automation industry, machines and devices will have self-descriptive semantic device data description to represent their data elements and services. This paper proposes an approach to integrate new machines and devices into an existing production system without any manual intervention. The proposed concept provides a Plug & Produce system architecture and evaluates its capabilities based on OPC UA. The concept also describes an easy and fast integration of the digital representation of new field devices into an existing production system."
87,Implementation of a Production-Control System Using Integrated Automation ML and OPC UA,"In the era of Industry 4.0, manufacturing systems must be well equipped with adaptable fabrication facilities and flexible production patterns to acquire â€œplug-and-produceâ€ capabilities for future production lines. However, the conventional engineering mode is so obsolete and inefficient that modern intelligent production requirements cannot be met any more. In this study, the architecture for an industrial process-control system is proposed using integrated AutomationML and OPC UA technologies. A lab-level experimental system was implemented and the system was executed to verify that the proposed architecture is reasonable and feasible in terms of actual performance."
91,The Use of OPC UA Technology in the Study of Models of Control Objects,A new technology OPC UA and its use in the study of microprocessor automation tools using computer models of control objects are considered.
92,Concept for Improved Automation of Distributed Systems with a Declarative Control based on OPC UA and REST,"The main difference between conventional automation and current approaches of digitized industrial processes is the use of the Internet. The Internet enables the development of distributed systems consisting of loosely coupled and interacting components such as robots, plants and control software. The components are not permanently tied to each other, but rather dynamically combined according to the specific requirements of the target system. This results in highly flexible systems that are distributed globally and across company boundaries. The development, maintenance and modification of various components is decentralized and can therefore lead to incompatibilities that can impair their interoperability. This paper describes an approach for the interaction of control software, which ensures interoperability of components in distributed systems. The underlying principles of REST are used to automatically identify properties in the structural models of OPC UA and use them to determine the required processes for further invocation. This enables extensive modifications of the individual components without creating incompatibilities."
95,Educational-development Workplace for Digital Twins using the OPC UA and Unity 3D,"Digital Twin technology has seen great advances in design, implementation and use in recent years. This article describes the combination of two key attributes of the Industry 4.0 concept - virtualization through Digital Twins and interoperability based on the OPC UA standard. For educational purposes, an experimental workplace and an educational-development environment for the design of Digital Twins using interoperability and the 3D engine Unity have been created. The presented methodology of Digital Twin creation was practically verified on available digital technologies."
96,Local Discovery Service for OPC-UA Devices,"This article presents the contribution of the Polytechnic Institute of Castelo Branco (IPCB) within the scope of PPS1 of the PRODUTECH SIF program - Solutions for the Future Industry, in terms of the definition of modules for scalability, adaptation, plug-and-play, with interoperability between processes and technologies inter/intra industrial plants. More specifically, its contribution for the definition, implementation and evaluation of OPC-UA device discovery services. Adopting the CompactRIO platform developed on PPS2 as a physical basis for a Smartbox, its development was extended during the present task with a view to incorporating and validating the adopted service discovery mechanisms in the program."
99,Automatic Integration of Simulated Systems into OPC UA Networks,"This paper demonstrates the integration of OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) communication capabilities in a simulation framework. The proposed approach is based on a data mapping from the simulation's meta data model to the OPC UA information model and a concurrent architecture based on message passing between the OPC UA server and the simulation software. The data mapping utilizes the simulation's and OPC UA's reflection mechanisms to automatically generate OPC UA address spaces from simulation models. The inverse mapping is used to automatically generate simulation model structure from queries to an existing OPC UA server. The concurrent architecture enables large numbers of simulated objects to be equipped with individual and independent OPC UA servers and clients. This allows the simulation of entire scenarios with simulated objects communicating with each other and with external software. The usefulness extends to distributed simulation use cases, where models populate individual instances of the simulation software and communicate over a real network. The implementation is applied to simulate an automotive production line, where multiple machines are equipped with individual OPC UA servers and communicate with 3rd party software. Stress tests show, that the implementation can handle significant network load."
105,Integration method of custom information models into existing OPC UA Servers,"Uniform semantic data representation along the value chain is important for correct data understanding and complex data processing based on it. Standardized information models (Companion Specifications, CS) in OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA), address this problem in the area of industrial communication. However, control system manufacturers who enable an OPC UA connection of their products do not always allow individualized data modelling according to the process-relevant CS. Therefore, this paper presents a methodology for the integration of standardized information models into existing OPC UA servers, which should be used as a basis for further data processing mechanisms. The methodology describes the steps of the integration process and focuses in particular on mapping possibilities of the original models to those created according to CS."
109,Integration of Robot and IIoT over the OPC Unified Architecture,"Cloud technology uses the main function of IoT (Internet of Things) devices to quickly transfer huge amounts of data because data must be transmitted efficiently and efficiently among equipments. IoT enables smart devices to collect and share data without manual assistance. Compared to IoT, IIoT (Industrial IoT) technology is used for industrial purposes, but common industrial communication protocols such as Modbus TCP and Profinet only provide real-time data and cannot provide safe and reliable historical data. The OPC unified architecture (OPC UA) overcomes the above shortcomings and changes the entire industrial communication protocol and resolves the issue of object-oriented concepts. Other IoT protocols such as RTI DDS and MQTT do not emphasize the integration of industrial equipments. In this paper, we provide a solution enabling the smart robotic arm (Staubli) to convert its original communication protocol (SOAP/WSDL) into the role of an OPC UA server. This solution is successfully integrated in ERP/MES manufacturing production systems. The proposed method can help basic IoT robots be seamlessly embedded in ERP/MES manufacturing systems. We demonstrated how the OPC UA cloud computing platform worked. When a PCB color image was uploaded from the client, the OPC UA server processed it by the Gaussian blur and Canny filters and then returned the processed image to the client in a gray-scale image."
115,Integrating an XPath-Enhanced OPC UA Data Collection Into Industrial Communication,"Recent trends lead to more and more available data from automated manufacturing systems. Many data scientists collect data from production machines via the fast and widespread OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) communication protocol. However, heterogeneous vendor-specific configurations require high manual effort for establishing new data collections, and therefore valuable metadata is either extracted hard-coded or not at all. Our previous publication tackled this challenge purely from a computer science perspective and proposed a transformation of the query language XPath to OPC UA to enable more convenient and expressive queries. Remaining open research questions include a more sophisticated data collection from multiple automated manufacturing systems and proper integration into enterprise-scaled industrial communication systems.This paper focuses the manufacturing perspective and covers these research questions with a real-world implementation for a 500 tons High Pressure Die Casting (HPDC) production cell with six embedded OPC UA servers. We formulate XPath queries and apply these to augment the current workflow, which only extracts raw sensor values, to a more comprehensive one that additionally captures metadata such as units, value ranges, and measurement precision. Our main contributions include an aggregation of multiple individual data collection setups into a general one and an embedding of these into a fully-fledged data lake integration. The results demonstrate an integration of an XPath-enhanced OPC UA data collection into industrial communication for automated manufacturing systems, which dramatically reduces complexity and manual effort for experts."
121,Concept for an Energy Data Aggregation Layer for Production Sites A Combination of AutomationML and OPC UA,"In industrial production facilities, technical Energy Management Systems are used to measure, monitor and display energy consumption related information. The measurements take place at the field device level of the automation pyramid. The measured values are recorded and processed at the control level. The functionalities to monitor and display energy data are located at the MES level of the automation pyramid. So the energy data from all PLCs has to be aggregated, structured and provided for higher level systems. This contribution introduces a concept for an Energy Data Aggregation Layer, which provides the functionality described above. For the implementation of this Energy Data Aggregation Layer, a combination of AutomationML and OPC UA is used."
124,The Integration of LwM2M and OPC UA: An Interoperability Approach for Industrial IoT,"Over the past years, Internet of Things (IoT) has been emerging with connected and smart things that can communicate with each other and exchange information. Similarly, with the emergence of Industry 4.0, the industrial world is also undergoing a strong evolution by connecting devices, sensors and machines to the Internet. In this paper, we investigate the integration of these two domains and examine the interconnection of two of the promising interoperability standards in these domains, namely OPC Unified Architecture and Lightweight Machine-to-Machine (LwM2M) protocol. For this purpose, we introduce an efficient and scalable approach, based on Docker Containers, for the cross-domain integration and interoperation. Besides, we also demonstrate and validate our interoperability approach by means of real world implementations and also theoretical and practical analysis."
126,Research and Implementation of Publish/Subscribe Communication Model Based on OPC UA,"In recent years, intelligent manufacturing has developed rapidly. Industrial IoT technologies are applied to different industrial scenarios. OPC UA is a service-oriented architecture, which has good interoperability. At the same time, it is a cross-platform communication standard that can realize the interconnection between heterogeneous network devices and solve the problem of information silos in the industrial IoT field. However, with the gradual increase of industrial equipment, the amount of data transmission in the network is increasing. The traditional OPC UA communication method based on client/server mode has defects such as tight coupling and performance bottleneck. It cannot meet the high throughput demand of the network. Therefore, these phenomena lead to longer time delays and lower transmission efficiency of network communication systems. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a publish/subscribe communication model based on OPC UA. We design the overall architecture of the OPC UA publish/subscribe model and adopt a message agent mechanism to realize distributed communication of OPC UA. This model has functions such as message modeling, address space construction, and publish/subscribe. The architecture of this communication model is compatible with the C/S model, which can ensure compatibility and coexistence with the traditional OPC UA communication system. Meanwhile, in order to improve the distinguished service capability of the OPC UA system, a multi-priority data scheduling algorithm is proposed and integrated into the publish/subscribe communication model to improve the efficiency of real-time data transmission in industrial networks. The experimental results show that the communication model can accomplish distributed communication in industrial networks and be better applied in wireless sensor networks. The scheduling algorithm included in the model significantly improves the efficiency of real-time data transmission and reduces the time delay."
130,Model of Integration Gateway for Communication of OPC/MQTT Devices,"This article deals with the challenge of how to integrate industrial devices that support either IoT protocols, such as MQTT devices with industrial de-facto standard protocol OPC UA. The main focus is paid on a model of integration gateway, which is designed to connect various devices and emulate device availability through the same application protocol. The goal is to create the model for bidirectional mapping of OPC variables to MQTT topics and validate proposed model in the lab environment."
132,An AutomationML/OPC UA-based Industry 4.0 Solution for a Manufacturing System,"Diverse customer demands are increasing the need for improved flexibility, adaptability, and transparency of production processes. This poses new challenges to modern manufacturing systems. Fortunately, advances associated with the fourth industrial revolution have provided many solutions to these challenges. In this study, an AutomationML (AML) and OPC UA-based solution is proposed for manufacturing process. By integrating AML and OPC UA, we developed a four-layer architecture dedicated to a manufacturing system referencing the Reference Architecture Model for Industry 4.0 (RAMI 4.0). Additionally, an experimental system was constructed to demonstrate the availability and applicability of the proposed approach. The system execution processes was also elaborated to better understand the processing of information flows across the whole system."
133,End System TSN Enablement Using OPC UA,"Adoption of TSN and OPC UA in industrial automation foresees their configuration and even co-configuration. However, resource-constrained end systems may not have the capacity for designated TSN configuration engines, and thus may benefit from access to the necessary configuration through OPC UA. This paper showcases such an example: a DI-compatible OPC UA information model and back-end that enable QoS/TSN configuration over OPC UA. The presented development precedes the OPC foundation FX group (Ex-FLC, Ex-Shapers) releases and addresses not only PubSub-relevant network configuration, but also client-server, clock synchronization, and transmission scheduling."
135,Real-Time Communication Model Based on OPC UA Wireless Network for Intelligent Production Line,"With the continuous development of intelligent manufacturing technology, the intelligent production line for the Industrial Internet of Things occupies an important position in the field of industrial intelligence. OPC UA is a standard for communication data exchange between intelligent production line devices. OPC UA can establish a unified information model for production line devices and improve the connectivity of heterogeneous networks. However, in industrial wireless network application scenarios, there are various types of sensing information and large amounts of data to be transmitted. Each type of data has different requirements for real-time. The traditional OPC UA communication method is difficult to achieve real-time and reliable transmission in intelligent production lines and canâ€™t meet the transmission requirements of time-sensitive data. In this paper, we propose a real-time communication model of the OPC UA wireless network for intelligent production lines (UAMPDS). IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH is used as the wireless communication infrastructure, and OPC UA protocols are fused to this model. Meanwhile, we design a load-aware time-slot scheduling algorithm to dynamically allocate and schedule time slots according to the network topology and traffic load of each node. We also implement a dynamic preemptive resource scheduling strategy based on service differentiation to ensure real-time transmission of time-sensitive data. The experimental results show that this model achieves differentiated services based on data with different latency tolerance and effectively reduces the transmission latency of real-time service data under the constrained network resources. It can avoid the starvation phenomenon of low priority queues, and improves the overall quality of service of intelligent production line communication networks."
139,TSN-Enabled OPC UA in Field Devices,"The paradigm of â€œIndustry 4.0â€ suggests that industrial automation systems will converge towards unified and standardized solutions. The concept of Industrial IoT, in turn, drives to interconnect them via deterministic networking. The alliance of these concepts promises to simplify the integration and management of complex multi-vendor automation systems. This paper investigates the emergence of the former aspect, namely - field device integration with the embedded OPC UA over TSN, using already available products."
141,PLC Integration into Industry 4.0 Middleware: Function Block Library for the Interaction with REST and OPC UA Asset Administration Shells,"An asset administration shell (AAS), as a key concept of Industry 4.0 (I4.0), provides a machine-accessible interface to any kind of asset. To enable interoperability and smooth integration of the devices into the I4.0 middleware, an application implementing the device's functionality should be able to interact with different AASs. In this work, we investigate the integration of the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) runtime systems into the I4.0 middleware. For doing this, we specify the function blocks (FBs) for connecting the PLCs with AASs and other I4.0 components, such as registry and discovery server. We analyze the requirements of such FBs while focusing on REST/HTTP- and OPC UA-based AASs, and provide interface specification for IEC 61499- and IEC 61131-3-based FBs. Furthermore, we implemented an FB library that enables communication with an AAS from the respective control applications. Those FBs allow accessing properties and invoking operations of remote AASs, as well as hosting AASs submodels. Common functionalities, such as registering the runtime system at the registry component, or finding AASs, are also supported. The results obtained in this paper will ease interaction with the complex AAS structure from the low-level devices."
142,Toward Industrial IoT: Integrated Architecture of an OPC UA Synergy Platform,"Recently, the manufacturing industry has revolutionized with â€˜smart manufacturingâ€™ and â€˜Industry 4.0â€™, and with the development of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), increasing number of physical objects can access network services. However, critical issues such as real-time communication, interoperability, and interlinking of internet and industrial devices are yet to be addressed. These issues arise from the problem of interconnectivity between smart manufacturing systems and non-semantic industrial equipment. Therefore, we referred to ISO/IEC 30141, a standard IoT reference architect document, to solve the interconnection problem and bridge the gap between the Internet and industry. Furthermore, we proposed a four-domain integrated architecture that divides the manufacturing system into user, cloud service, sensing & controlling, and device domains. The proposed architecture is validated by constructing the applicable industrial pick-and-place testbed for the manufacturing system. Thus, this testbed can serve as guideline to examine the state of the art of the OPC UA PubSub based protocol in addition to several other types of protocol approaches."
145,Realising Interoperability Between OPC UA and OCF,"The paper deals with the interoperability issue inside Industry 4.0. Definition and adoption of communication standards are of paramount importance to improve the interoperability of industrial applications. For this reason, during the last few years, different organisations have developed reference architectures to align standards in the context of the fourth industrial revolution. Among them, an important role is played by OPC UA international standard (IEC 62541). Application in industrial contexts of modern Information & Communication Technology (ICT) concepts, such as Internet of Things (IoT), is a keypoint in Industry 4.0. For this reason, the current literature presents several proposals aimed to improve interoperability between reference standards in Industry 4.0 and IoT ecosystems. The paper proposes a solution towards interoperability between OPC UA and IoT, based on the mapping of OPC UA and Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) specifications defined very recently to enable the interoperability inside the IoT ecosystem. Although other examples of integration of OPC UA with the IoT are present in the current literature, the proposal is original as interoperability between OPC UA and OCF has not been treated until now. The proposal may also have a potential impact on the current definition of OCF specifications, as it will be pointed out in the paper."
148,OPC UA Nodestore Switch - Usage Scenarios,"OPC Unified Architecture is one of the leading technologies to realize the horizontal and vertical communication from enterprise layer down to the field layer in automation technology. It defines an address space model consisting of nodes and references without specifying how to store these. Therefore, this paper first describes the concept of a nodestore and a nodestore switch. The core contribution of the nodestore switch is the decoupling of OPC UA servers from their node storage. Based on this, four usage scenarios demonstrate how to utilize the concept to address different requirements, like performance and persistence, the integration of domain specific (proprietary) meta models, the adaptation at runtime and sharing of information models. For each usage scenario a prototypical implementation is described to show an exemplary realization and to gather a deeper understanding of the usage."
149,Configuration Solution for TSN-based Industrial Networks utilizing SDN and OPC UA,"Increasing customization and dynamically allocated services for data analytics and production optimisation are forcing the industrial networks of the future to become more flexible and adaptive. Moreover, future converged networks require a higher degree of scalability and performance. Three technologies are currently under special observation for solving this issue: Time-Sensitive Networking, Software-defined Networking and OPC UA.This paper combines these three technologies into one network architecture. This architecture shows that it is possible to configure time-sensitive traffic streams by leveraging the Time-Sensitive Networking methods for synchronisation and Time Aware Shaping in combination with forwarding methods coming from Software-defined Networking. OPC UA is utilized as the link for industrial applications to interact with the network management and transmit their demands on the network service. Additionally, OPC UA serves as the data exchange technology among industrial applications by utilizing OPC UA PubSub and leveraging Quality-of-Service queues according Time-Sensitive Networking standards.It can be shown that the combination is a reasonable solution and a promising field for further investigation."
150,A configuration tool for MQTT based OPC UA PubSub,"Contemporary manufacturing enterprises are challenged by fast-growing requirements for flexible and effective production, and also rapidly changing demands of market.

To achieve these requirements, technologies and paradigms such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Reconfigurable Manufacturing System (RMS) and Industrie 4.0, etc., are proposed and developed in recent years. Among these solutions, Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture (OPC UA) is one of the most widely used specifications for industrial system and device communication. Now the specification is extended by adding a new communication architecture named PubSub to provide asynchronous information exchange capability. After a brief review of industrial Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and existing solutions for the manufacturing system, an MQTT based OPC UA PubSub implementation and its configuration tool are introduced in this paper. Our OPC UA PubSub implementation can be easily integrated into other C/C++ OPC UA projects."

151,Implicit Templates for Conformance Units in OPC UA Companion Specifications,"Due to its importance in the Industry 4.0 movement, the usage of OPC UA has increased in recent years. More and more vendor-independent and domain-specific models are developed as so-called Companion Specifications. OPC UA Profiles allow to subdivide functionality within the Companion Specifications, and thus offer flexibility to the standards. An OPC UA Profile is a set of individually testable entities called Conformance Units, which are also defined within the Companion Specification. In this work, similarities between Conformance Units defined by different working groups are analyzed and grouped in CU classes by the scope of the Conformance Units. For the most prevalent CU classes, textual templates are suggested, based on the typical formulations in existing Companion Specifications. These templates are intended to ease the development of Companion Specifications and the Conformance Units therein. The CU classes identified in this work suggest the templates can be used for more than two-thirds of the Conformance Units in a Companion Specification. The CU classes and templates are also a step towards automation in the generation of OPC UA Companion Specification Documents and test cases for the Conformance Units."
164,An Introduction to OPC UA TSN for Industrial Communication Systems,"The industrial communication market is dominated by Ethernet-based fieldbus systems. Although they share similar requirements and market segments, their implementations and ecosystems differ considerably. As a result, end customers and device manufacturers are faced with a multitude of technologies that need to be produced, run, diagnosed, maintained, and kept in stock. Although the availability of products and services is largely satisfactory, dealing with multiple solutions generates high costs and limits IoT capability. This paper introduces Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture Time-Sensitive Networking (OPC UA TSN) as a new technology and presents the current view. This time, the industrial prospects of fulfilling industrial communication requirements while leveraging the cost benefits of standard Ethernet hardware in the midterm are in reach. We anticipate that OPC UA TSN will reveal itself as a game changer in the field of industrial automation, being a candidate for establishing a holistic communication infrastructure from the sensor to the cloud."
166,Practical Implementation of an OPC UA TSN Communication Architecture for a Manufacturing System,"In modern manufacturing systems, various industrial communication systems (e.g., fieldbus systems and industrial Ethernet networks) have been used to realize reliable information exchange. However, these industrial communication solutions are largely incompatible with each other, which do not satisfy the new requirements of Industry 4.0. Recently Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) has been developed to improve the real-time capabilities to the standard Ethernet, and is considered to be a promising real-time communication solution for Industry 4.0. In this work, we propose a communication architecture for a manufacturing system using the Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA) and TSN technologies. TSN is adopted as the communication backbone to connect heterogeneous industrial automation subsystems. The OPC UA is adopted to realize horizontal and vertical communication between subsystems in the field layer and the entities of the upper layers. We implement a laboratory-level manufacturing system to validate the proposed architecture. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and capability of the proposed architecture. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of a key TSN substandard, i.e., IEEE 802.1Qbv, in the laboratory-level manufacturing system. The evaluation results demonstrate that IEEE 802.1Qbv can indeed provide excellent real-time capabilities for industrial applications."
167,Enabling OPC UA and oneM2M Interworking,"Industry 4.0 features the application of modern Information & Communication Technology concepts in industrial contexts to create more flexible and innovative products and services leading to new added-value business models. Realization of this fourth industrial revolution may be achieved only if enough effort is invested to introduce interoperability between industrial applications. For this reason, current literature presents a lot of proposals aimed to improve interoperability between reference communication standards of Industry 4.0. Among them, several research activities aim to reach this goal by proposing interworking solutions between standard communication systems. Although OPC UA and oneM2M play very important roles inside Industry 4.0, interworking between them is not available at this moment. For this reason, the paper aims to propose a novel solution towards OPC UA and oneM2M interworking."
173,Interoperability of OPC UA PubSub with Existing Message Broker Integration Architectures,"Interoperable communication technologies are of key importance in production systems with increasing needs for data in their adoption of data-driven methodologies and new, emerging applications. OPC UA PubSub defines an alternative to the traditional client-server communication with a publish-subscribe model for data to cater to scalability and data-driven cloud application needs. In this paper, the OPC UA PubSub model is compared to some other message broker and communication technologies and integrated with an existing message based integration model for evaluating the interoperability. A case example is presented where data payloads and information security practices are integrated using an adapter approach."
177,OPC UA-based Asset Administration Shell,Industry 4.0 is really changing the manufacturing through the convergence of physical systems and their digital counterparts with Information Technology as an enabler. The Asset Administration Shell is core to Industry 4.0 components. Very recently a relevant metamodel has been defined. The paper presents its mapping with OPC UA achieved extending the relevant information model.
178,From ISA 88/95 meta-models to an OPC UA-based development tool for CPPS under IEC 61499,"In the era of Industry 4.0, fast-growing requirements for an agile and effective vertical integration are challenging the smart manufacturing. Cyber-Physical Production System (CPPS) technology plays a key role in the Industry 4.0 factory. One of the reasons for this is that shop floor data collection, monitoring and processing are enabled by CPPS devices together with IEC 61499 standard. To this end modeling and developing software and hardware components focused on distributed control systems are provided. This improvement in data monitoring and processing results not only in an optimization of equipment predictive maintenance but also in the ability to integrate new control techniques. This approach provides the Oil&Gas industry with the foundation to transform their traditional production fields into Intelligent Oil Field (IOF) environments. The aim of this paper is to build bridges between the state of technology and the design of industrial control applications. In particular, a CPPS platform developed through a software engineering tool giving support to the design of applications is proposed. It is based on the IEC 61499 and on a configurable OPC-UA server that maps field device data into an ISA95/88-based information model. Thus, this proposal will not only save Oil&Gas engineer time, it also will save efforts of adopting this promising technology."
181,Improving interoperability of Virtual Commissioning toolchains by using OPC-UA-based technologies,"It is well-known that one the most important challenges in industrial manufacturing processes is the reduction of lead-times and delays during the on-site commissioning. In applications in which several automation systems are used, such as in aeronautics or automotive manufacturing cells, several PLC's and drives are used to control the motion of the different electromechanical components. In order to verify and validate (V&V) automation code before deployment in the production environment, virtual commissioning (VC) techniques have become of great interest in the last decades. Even if VC simulation approaches, based on software/hardware-in-the-loop (SiL, HiL), have shown effectiveness to V&V automation code, the continuity from the execution to the simulation layers may not be ensured due to a lack of interoperability in the toolchain. Additionally, the development of reliable component models is a complex task of the VC solution since it requires a high level of mechatronics expertise. In order to avoid losing information between the execution and the simulation layers of VC toolchains, this paper presents a SiL based approach for interconnecting the PLC's with the VC simulation tool by means of OPC-UA-based technologies. In addition, in order to develop the functional models, we propose a library-based development. This will facilitate seamless flow of information between different PLC editors and the simulation layer. SiL simulations of the suggested approach on an automotive manufacturing cell are performed and show digital continuity from the execution to the simulation layer."
183,Opportunities For A Hardware-Based OPC UA Server Implementation In Industry 4.0,"With the advent of the fourth industrial revolution i.e. Industry 4.0, plants and factories are becoming smarter and interconnected. The transitions demand vertical integration and seamless connectivity. For this purpose, there is a need for semantic communication between various devices including the heavily resource-constrained field devices. To address this, a real-time capable hardware-based implementation of a well-established semantic communication protocol, i.e. OPC Unified Architecture was designed and developed. This chip-based implementation is power-efficient and compact, making it suitable for the field level. The chip was analyzed and incorporated in a demonstrator as a proof of concept of its integration at field level in a plant module of the process industry. Various opportunities are also examined where the chip could be utilized to deliver benefits to existing and future technologies."
196,A Prefatory Study on Data Channelling Mechanism towards Industry 4.0,"Data are increasing in volume, variety and velocity in this Internet of things and big data era. It applies from industry (or manufacturing) process monitoring control to video surveillance analysis to track human and machines activities. Therefore, fast and accurate approaches in data channelling are needed to effectively deal with these big data. This paper presents practical methods to manage and transfer the data from industry manufacturing site to a centralized data processing hub. In this hub, data are transformed into understandable information, which can assist human in understanding and monitoring manufacturing situation autonomously. These data are collected and channelled to desired location for analysis through Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture (OPC UA). Industrial protocols and standards are used to interpret the data channelling methods and tested on several industrial machines. Result shows that size of data and number of OPC UA Client that connects to OPC Server affects the data channelling speed."
201,Common Management Technology of Automation Equipment in Industry 4.0,"The purpose of Industry 4.0 is to make the automation for industry and the current trends of technological innovations to use or produce equipment with IT technologies. This research uses AutomationML language as the main structure of Asset Administration Shell (AAS), which refers to the relevant specifications and standards of OPC to build and combine OPC UA (Open Process Control Unified Architecture) to realizes the information and communication layer in the six functions of RAMI4.0."
202,Automatic Information Model Generation for Industrial Edge Applications Based on IEC 61499 and OPC UA,The Industry 4.0 and Industrial Internet provides vertical and horizontal integration between edge devices and industrial cloud platforms. A flexible and interoperable information model is crucial for enabling device-level intelligence as well as cloud-edge collaboration. Deep integration between the control and information model is necessary for supporting closed-loop optimization between the cloud and edge devices. This paper proposes an automatic information model generation method based on the IEC 61499 and OPC UA standards. Model transformation rules between two models from design time to runtime are presented. A discrete manufacturing case study is used to prove that the proposed method can significantly reduce the development time for distributed information models. The integrated control and information models at runtime can provide strong support for dynamic reconfiguration to address changing requirements.
210,A systematic top-down information modelling approach for workshop-type manufacturing systems,Workshop-type manufacturing systems grow over time and therefore they have heterogeneous communication interfaces. Digitalization can be an enabler to lowering their costs and improving their performance. This can be facilitated with the introduction of common information models. But the widespread introduction of information models in such manufacturing environments is entailed with significant efforts and risks. This paper describes how existing workshop-type manufacturing environments can be documented in such a way that they can subsequently be reproduced in an OPC UA information model.
213,Function Blocks for the Interaction with the Asset Administration Shell,"An asset administration shell (AAS), as a key concept of the Industry 4.0, provides a machine-accessible interface to any kind of asset. An application implementing the devices functionality should be able to interact with different AASs.In this work, we specify the function blocks (FBs) for accessing properties and invoking operations of AASs. We analyzed the nature and requirements of such FBs while focusing on REST/HTTP- and OPC UA-based AASs and provided IEC 61499-based implementation.The results obtained in this paper will ease interaction with the complex AAS structure from the low-level devices."
222,Design and Application of Cloud Platform Based on OpenStack in Remote Online Collection and Monitoring System of Intelligent Workshop,"With the development of information technology, network technology, Internet technology, cloud computing technology and so on are more and more widely used in various industries. The traditional industrial automation hierarchy structure is complex and the integration degree is not high. It can not meet the development needs of informationization and intelligence, and is limited by the site infrastructure. Therefore, this paper designs a remote online acquisition and monitoring system architecture for intelligent workshop based on OpenStack private cloud computing, which completes the functions of data acquisition, online monitoring, database management and real-time control. In addition, this paper also considers the characteristics of the system architecture, such as filing, disaster tolerance and security. Using OPC UA protocol and Modbus RTU protocol to complete data acquisition, data interaction between the bottom of the factory and the bottom of the enterprise. At the same time, cloud computing data center centralized storage and management of the collected data, which provides great convenience for the follow-up analysis of large data in the workshop, and has a certain practical value."
223,Analyzing Manufacturing Data in a Digital Control Room Making Use of Semantic Annotations,"The German manufacturing industry carries out new developments towards Industry 4.0, which focus on smart factories and smart assistance systems. In this paper, we present our digital control room for analyzing manufacturing data aiming at optimizing production processes. It builds upon our digital boardroom - a multi-display environment integrating multitouch and multiuser-based annotation dashboards so that decision makers gain insights into and can discuss an organization's data. In particular, our digital control room integrates the OPC UA protocol, semantic annotations, and a time series database to analyze, visualize and interact with machine data. Thereby, it can combine real time, near-real time, and batch processing of machine data and constitutes a holistic business intelligence environment."
232,Reducing integration effort for cyber-physical systems through integrated information modelling using annotated application code,"Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) increasingly make use of modelling technologies like OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA). These modelling technologies already reduce integration efforts as they provide a common Application Programming Interface (API) to handle and access properties and methods that are exposed by applications running on the CPS. These properties and methods can be structured and enriched with semantics within an information model. The integration of the information model with the application is still a quite complex task that typically requires comparable large manual programming efforts and additional components to manage the interaction between application and model. This work targets especially at more complex applications that shall be configurable through the information model - therefore a use case of a configurable state-machine is discussed in this work. To manage the interaction between such a dynamic application and an information model, a tight coupling of both is required. This work targets at re-use and integration of application code with information modelling based on annotations added to the application code. As a result, the object-structure and the (business) logic of the objects is integrated with the model. Finally, the external consumer can not only read, write and browse the exposed properties and methods of the application, but also create, update and delete objects within the object-structure with minimal additional manual efforts."
234,A Low-latency and Interoperable Industrial Internet of Things Architecture for Manufacturing Systems,"Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) as an emerging and prospective paradigm, has great potential to significantly improve production efficiency of manufacturing systems. An open data exchange standard, namely OPCUA, has been proposed for the IIoT systems to provide semantic interoperability over heterogeneous devices. However, a mass of traditional devices that do not support OPC UA, are still operating in legacy automation systems. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a three-layer IIoT architecture for manufacturing system, which combines OPC UA-based gateways and Time-Sensitive Software-Defined Networking (TSSDN) switches to realize the efficient and reliable communication. The OPC UA is adopted to realize the interoperability of heterogeneous devices and the TSSDN achieves centralized control of network resources and flexible configuration in real-time industrial networks. Finally, we design a smart factory test bed, to evaluate the applicability of the proposed system architecture, in which we implement the information model and data transmission based on OPC UA."
240,A Real-time Computation Task Reconfiguration Mechanism for Industrial Edge Computing,"The growth of massive generated data from the industrial field results in performance reduction on network bandwidth, real-time response, and communication latency. For distributed industrial automation systems, edge computing suits better than cloud computing from real-time constraints purpose. Furthermore, the integration of OPC UA in edge computing nodes improves interoperability and compatibility. This paper focuses on computation task reconfiguration issues among physically neighboring nodes based on OPC UA. Considering the high real-time requirement in industrial edge computing, a task reconfiguration mechanism is proposed and a real-time workload reallocation algorithm for optimization without any iteration process. Finally, a case study on a triplex reciprocating pump with a multi-class faults simulation model proves that it can improve task execution efficiency without worsening classification accuracy much."
241,Service and Agent based System Architectures for Industrie 4.0 Systems,"Industrie 4.0 is based on three pillars: Vertical Integration, Horizontal Integration and Consistency of Engineering over Product Life Cycle. The implementation of systems to realize these pillars requires an architecture enabling interoperability of distributed components and their digital representations. Potential middleware concepts for an architecture are the service-oriented architectures OPC UA, JADEX/JADEX and Arrowhead. A holistic and modular I4.0 architecture using agent technology to implement Digital Twins and thereby decouples communication middleware from processes and hardware is proposed."
245,An Industrial Marketplace - the Smart Factory Web Approach and Integration of the International Data Space,"Smart Factory Web is a platform for smart factories to enable flexible sharing and management of assets and resources to maximize efficiency and provide visibility on a global market. To join the Smart Factory Web, participants describe their factory capabilities, which are modelled in an ontology. AutomationML is used to assist with this modelling. OPC UA is used as a communication protocol for factory live-data from the machines. However, factory owners are hesitant to share critical production data. Therefore, the communication has to be secure and in the best case, provide control mechanisms for the data owners. The International Data Space is a peer-to-peer network that will support secure exchange of data and data usage control. In this paper, the Smart Factory Web approach is discussed and extended by an implementation with the current state of the International Data Space."
246,Digitizing a Distributed Textile Production Process using Industrial Internet of Things: A Use-Case,"Many textile production chains are highly fragmented and distributed over several locations and countries. Textile machinery usually relies on proprietary software and hardware that cannot be sufficiently interlinked. As a result, machine and product data is not comprehensively collected and analyzed across the whole production process. Thus, the potential of Smart Manufacturing and Industry 4.0 is often not fully exploited in the textile industry. In recent years, vendor-independent machine to machine communication protocols and standards, such as OPC UA and MQTT have been suggested for the digitization of production facilities by integrating or replacing these proprietary systems. In contrast, there is still a lack of publicly available working demonstrations and exemplary implementations in the textile context. In this paper, we use Industrial Internet of Things technologies to design an open digital infrastructure for textile manufacturing. We develop our approach based on a production use-case that is distributed across multiple locations. By machine networking and integrating information flows from the shop floor to the cloud, we lay the basis for getting most value out of process-wide collected data. Our suggested infrastructure supports the use of Machine Learning techniques to enable various Smart Manufacturing applications, such as Predictive Maintenance and Predictive Quality."
251,I4.0-compliant integration of assets utilizing the Asset Administration Shell,"Global trends such as mass customization and lot size one, demand flexibility, autonomy and adaptability in production. Interoperability of devices is a key challenge as production systems evolve into Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS). As part of the German strategic project Industrie 4.0 (I4.0), concepts and solutions for continuous digitization of production are being developed, in order to meet these numerous challenges. The concept of the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) was introduced in order to provide data and information in a standardized and semantically described manner, thus enabling interoperability and easy interaction. In this paper, we show how users can translate a semantic description of plants, machines or individual components that are based on a standardized Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture (OPC UA) information model, into the AAS information model."
254,Integration of IIoT Communication Protocols in Distributed Control Applications,"Trends using Internet technologies in the industrial domain have more and more influence on the design of applications and provide more options for data exchange. This paper proposes concepts to integrate communication protocols, which are very often used in combination with IIoT, into the distributed control domain at shop floor. Originally used for vertical integration, IIoT protocols such as MQTT or OPC UA can also be used for horizontal communication between industrial devices in a distributed control system following the CPS approach. This makes it possible to adapt production processes dynamically, highly flexibly and efficiently to new requirements from a product or logistics perspective. First results show that the concepts can achieve a good transmission performance, which is sufficient for very many production processes to be automated."
269,Digital Twins for Manufacturing Using UML and Behavioral Specifications,"Using digital twins, physical manufacturing objects can be virtualized and represented as digital models which are seamlessly integrated in both the physical and the digital space. This allows to simulate, verify and optimize production systems, from the logistical aspects to the manufacturing process and the involved components. A key challenge, in this area, is how to describe digital twins in complex manufacturing systems such that all physical details, processes, and verification needs are modeled at an appropriate and efficient abstraction level, e.g., modeling and detecting divers faults in production processes. To address this challenge, in this paper we present our work on modeling digital twins of manufacturing facilities using UML. UML class diagrams are used to describe static dependencies between entities, as well as to monitor and analyze the dynamic verification and quality aspects of manufacturing such as fault detection and consistency checks. Utilizing the key relevant features of UML in our approach, the designed class diagrams are used and enriched with behavioral models serving as digital twins which can be updated by live data from the manufacturing plant. We present a small example based on simulation programs and a demonstrator. The presented modeling approach and example provide useful insights to UML-based design of digital twins in complex manufacturing systems."
271,An approach for an industrial information model management,"An overall information model of an industrial cyberphysical system consists of different sub information models. These sub information models contain attributes and methods that describe parts of the overall information model such as a machine or an order. Every entity within a company has varying requirements in terms of information it needs to represent, or read from the information model. In contrary, especially in environments with a large number of system entities, it is necessary to standardize the information models as much as possible to optimize economic and performance potentials. To address this challenge this paper presents an approach for information model management. This is done via the creation of rules for information modelling and the forming of an enterprise specific information model library."
276,The Asset Administration Shell of Operator in the Platform of Industry 4.0,"We discuss the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) concept of Industry 4.0 (I4.0), characterizing the current status of industrial automation and outlining the advantages of more deeply digitized manufacturing where the AAS is employed. In the proposed analysis, the basic subjects are apply complemented with possible submodels and standards of the Asset Administration Shell (identification, communication, engineering, configuration, safety, security, life cycle status, energy efficiency, condition monitoring, and examples of AAS-based applications). An exemplary interaction pattern directed towards the domain, or specific submodels in the AAS, is also introduced in the given context. Further, the authors propose a specific digital example of an operator using a smart jacket."

292,Dynamic integration of manual and automated biological process skills into MES,"The manual cultivation of biological cells is very time- and cost-intensive. The automation of these processes promises significant cost savings as well as the required transparency and quality of the results. Biological cell cultivation protocols are constantly being researched and modified, which enormously increases the flexibility requirements for the plant technology. An important aspect is the early consideration of different laboratory equipment and the possibility of step-by-step partial automation of biological processes. In the course of process development and automation, it helps that manually executed process parts can be transparently integrated into the higher-level process control before they are automated using suitable laboratory equipment. Furthermore, device failures can be replaced by manual process execution. This paper presents a method for mapping biological skills using OPC UA models and integrating them into automated plants."
