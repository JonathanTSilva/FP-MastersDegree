2,Towards a Web-of-Things Approach for OPC UA Field Device Discovery in the Industrial IoT,"In the opc UA standard, the opc UA information model is the key to semantic interoperability. It refers to an organized structure representing resources in the form of opc UA nodes residing in an opc UA address space. Before runtime, an opc UA server requires an opc UA information model already filled with opc UA nodes corresponding to the available resources of its field devices. It is tricky to the Industrial Internet of Things, a scenario where random field devices can join a sys-tem at any time. Indeed, the opc UA server needs to dynamically discover such devices and update its opc UA information model with new relevant opc UA nodes. Regarding the above challenge, this paper introduces a Web-of-Things (WoT) approach that enables field devices to register with an opc UA server to join the system without manual configuration. The approach relies on WoT Discovery and WoT Thing Description"
6,OPC UA Server Development Technology Based on Domestic Industrial Control Configuration Software,"Aiming at the problem of weak semantic information service ability of domestic industrial control configuration software, this paper studies the key technology of integrated application of industrial control configuration software and OPC UA, packages OPC UA server source code into functional blocks complying with IEC61131-3 international standard, on the basis of domestic AnyControl configuration software and its secondary development kit, and designs OPC UA information model creation module. Thus, OPC UA service can be opened through function blocks in configuration software and the OPC UA information model can be developed visually with low code. By verifying on Arm+Linux platform, this paper shows that the OPC UA service can be started quickly and a four-layer information model can be created by using the domestic configuration software. The OPC UA service function of the domestic industrial control configuration software is realized, which is beneficial for the industrial control system and software developers to quickly master the development technology of OPC UA."
10,Hard Real-Time Capable OPC UA Server as Hardware Peripheral for Single Chip IoT Systems,"The fast semantics project examines the use of the OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) in embedded industrial systems and proposes the design of a customizable, hard real time capable OPC UA Intellectual Property Core (IP Core) for single chip computing plattforms. This allows using OPC UA in both novel energy efficient sensor applications and in state of the art field devices. These single chip OPC UA servers form the semantic data sources for future applications such as cloud based added value services or machine learning applications. This article presents the design alternatives and first synthesis results for the implementation of OPC UA servers in embedded systems."
11,From Requirement Specification to OPC UA Information Model Design: A Product Assembly Line Monitoring Case Study,"Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture (OPC UA) has emerged as a highly-demanded standard in building industrial systems. One factor in this success is the concepts of OPC UA address space and OPC UA information model. OPC UA address space provides a mechanism to represent the resources of an OPC UA server and its field devices as OPC UA nodes. OPC UA information model structures OPC UA nodes as a schema. Once other devices and systems understand the schema, they can interact appropriately with the industrial system. Thus, designing the OPC UA information model is an undeniable and essential practice of OPC UA-based industrial system engineering. However, both academia and industry suffer from a lack of shared experiences on this subject. This gap motivated us to share our experiences on the development of an OPC UA information model. These experiences are based on an actual product assembly line monitoring case study developed at CEA LIST. Overall, in this paper, we aim to throw some light on the steps involved in the transformation of a requirement specification into an OPC UA information model."
16,A Compliance Testing Structure for Implementation of Industry Standards through OPC UA,"Information exchange across different departments in factories must be structured and verified for effective production processes. However, any such exchange across networks to clients must be compliant to company standards so that uniformity and security in data dispensation is maintained. Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA) solutions provide users with the flexibility of discharging information through network based protocols. This paper aims to build a compliance testing methodology for external vendors of an organisation who are interconnected with the OPC UA Server-Client Protocols. The structure is built on a host of UA clients that test UA specifications and information models from these vendors. This enables an organisational entity, for example, a manufacturer, to provide its clients, in this case external vendors such as suppliers, with the flexibility of conforming to prescribed standards in a testing phase on an automated digital platform rather than with older methods such as data transfer though databases or documents. An implementation of this approach is presented using example servers created for this purpose. It follows that external vendors can perform compliance testing and possibly improve their standards to match the company standards through remote testing after proper authentication measures provided by OPC UA."
19,Implementation of Energy Data Acquisition Gateway Based on OPC UA,"In order to solve the problem caused by heterogeneous data communication and non-uniform data specification in energy data acquisition, an energy data acquisition gateway based on OPC UA (OPC unified architecture) technology which supports three protocols of ZigBee, BACnet/IP and KNX is proposed and designed. The IMX287 ARM9 microprocessor and embedded Linux operation system are adopted as the hardware and software platform in this gateway. Also the application, hardware framework and software function framework of multi-protocol gateway are illustrated and the configuration of the gateway is performed based on the embedded Web server. Finally, the standard OPC UA energy data server has been developed. It is proved in practice that the energy data acquisition gateway based on OPC UA can support the conversion from different fieldbus protocols to OPC UA data model, providing a unified data access interface and addressing the heterogeneous communication network."
20,Research on Communication Method of OPC UA Client Based on ARM,"The OPC UA standard overcomes many disadvantages of the traditional OPC, and has significant advantages in platform independence, communication security and model construction, thus completing the information exchange under different platforms and interfaces. At present, the automation system equipment has the problems of complex protocols and interfaces and poor portability of industrial computer. To solve this problem, this paper develops the ARM embedded OPC UA client to complete the data communication with the automation system device server by porting the open62541 open source library on the ARM embedded device equipped with the FreeRTOS system. In this research, by building the OPC UA client on the embedded system, the connection and communication with the server are realized, which is also cheap and flexible to use. Experiments show that the system can be used in equipment debugging, field operation and emergency control, and has a wide range of application prospects and practical value."
23,An OPC UA-Compliant Interface of Data Analytics Models for Interoperable Manufacturing Intelligence,"The open platform communications unified architecture (OPC UA) has received attention as a standard for data interoperability in industries. In particular, OPC UA extends its applicability across various industrial sectors by publishing OPC UA companion specifications created in collaboration with other industrial consortiums. However, OPC UA is limited to ensure the interoperability of data analytics models because the relevant companion specifications have not been developed yet. OPC UA should be extended to implement such model interoperability so that machines seamlessly use and share data analytics models across the layers of manufacturing systems to predict and optimize their performance autonomously and collaboratively in terms of interoperable manufacturing intelligence. This article proposes an OPC UA-compliant interface for the exchange of predictive model markup language (PMML), a domain-independent standard for representing XML-based data analytics models. This article includes the design of mapping rules and OPC UA information models for the exchange between PMML and OPC UA, as well as the implementation of an OPC UA server-client prototype to publish and subscribe to OPC UA-compliant regression and neural network models which have been transformed from PMML-based models."
25,OpenModelica OPC UA framework for control applications,"OpenModelica is a general purpose modeling and simulation platform, extremely useful for modeling and simulation. As it comes bundled with it, an OPC UA server is readily available to all OpenModelica users, without additional installation/configuration work. We deployed this OPC UA server with the OPC UA client, implemented through the Python language in Raspberry Pi. The communication is validated through the control of a first order transfer function. A multi-product batch distillation column was also simulated in this framework. In all of the problems, the results are correct, and as per literature findings."
26,Development of OPC UA based centralized server Fieldbus data high efficiency transmit architecture,"In last few years industrial communication system is one of the most important innovations in factory and process automation systems. Many applications of industrial control are changing as communication technology advances, this also brings new opportunities and challenges to fieldbus system. In this paper, we proposed one new fieldbus data transmit architecture. The proposed architecture includes one OPC UA (OPC Unified Architecture) based centralized server, it used to replace the traditional fieldbus direct connection between fieldbus master station and PLC. The high capacity and high-speed characteristics of OPC UA structure are utilized to realize efficient and high timeliness fieldbus data transmission. Under this architecture, we propose a concept of data converter, it used to provide high compatibility with old and new fieldbus devices to reduce the cost of automation system upgrading. Proposed architecture has obvious advantages in multi PLC joint work environment."
27,Real-time capable OPC-UA Programs over TSN for distributed industrial control,"A key aspect of Industry 4.0 is the continuous interconnectedness of components. The standardized industrial communication protocol OPC UA offers a solution to this problem by enabling the exchange of data between the shop floor level and the inter-enterprise level. Due to the integration of the Time Sensitive Network (TSN) into OPC UA, it is now even possible to exchange information in real-time. Especially on the shop floor, there are numerous heterogeneous distributed devices from sensors to robots which must communicate with each other in real-time to achieve a distributed industrial control. Therefore, we propose an approach to combine real-time communication over TSN with OPC UA Programs to synchronize multiple distributed OPC UA Programs and exchange process data between them without losing real-time guarantees. This can be seen as the enabler of Plug-and-Produce with real-time requirements."
37,Early Lessons Learned from the Development of a Local OPC UA-based Robotic Testbed for Research,"OPC UA has been emerging as a widely-adopted standard in the industry. An OPC UA system represents its resources using an information model. This information model relies on the base OPCUA information model proposed by OPC Foundation, and is extensible with information models from other companion specifications and user-defined information models. When the system specification and design evolve, system developers need to update the information model from the system design. It is tricky for testbeds that frequently are updated with new devices, protocols, and development tools demanded by different use cases. This paper shares our long-term OPC UA-based robotic testbed for Industry 4.0 research and the strategy to develop it. The testbed's development follows the SysML standard for system specification and design and the OPC UA standard for system implementation. Its information model relies on the information models: OPCUA for Devices and VDMA OPC UA for Robotics."
40,OPC UA Information Model and a Wrapper for IEC 61499 Runtimes,"OPC UA is considered as an important communication technology for Industry 4.0 components. On the other hand, IEC 61499 is one of the technologies available for developing applications to the same components. In this paper, a proposal for an OPC UA information model for IEC 61499 systems is developed in order to enhance communication with IEC 61499 applications through OPC UA. Already existing related information models, particularly OPC UA for Devices and IEC 61131-3, are utilized as models and parts of the design. An OPC UA wrapper for IEC 61499 runtimes is presented as one possible way to implement the information model. Both the information model and the wrapper are then tested through a case study."
41,Research and application of OPC UA server based on resource constrained platform STM32,"In view of the rapid development trend of intelligent manufacturing and the application status of OPC UA protocol in the field of intelligent manufacturing, the requirement of building OPC UA server on resource constrained platform is proposed. By building STM32 platform and FreeRTOS system environment, the transplantation and operation of OPC UA protocol stack in resource limited platform are realized, the main memory space occupied by OPC UA protocol stack is analyzed, and the implementation path is proposed for later optimization. Through experimental verification, the OPC UA protocol stack runs on the resource limited platform, and the server can be widely used and popularized in the resource limited platform."
46,Dynamic Adjustment Mechanism based on OPC-UA Architecture for IIoT Applications,"In much smart Industry Internet of Things (IIoT) applications, there are many emergencies information processing e.g. fire and urgent accidents. However, when data which is from different source and format is lack of collation, integration and preprocess, the server loading will be too heave to process the information on time. This study mainly proposes to establish an Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA) architecture system for IIoT application design and introduces a dynamic node adjustment mechanism to be applied under the OPC UA architecture. The dynamic adjustment node is designed with network bandwidth monitor to solve the problem of excessive network load caused by emergency information transmission in the IIoT applications."
49,An OPC UA Multi-Server Aggregator with Cache Management,"OPC UA (Object Linking and Embedding for Process Control Unified Architecture) has drawn extensive attention in Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT), for it enables secure data exchanges between different operating systems and devices. In the field of industrial control, the applications of OPC UA are gradually extended to the field layer, which adopt the popular client-server interaction model. However, as the number of underling servers increases, the management of the upper layer becomes more difficult. Moreover, there are few kinds of software supporting OPC UA multi-server aggregation currently and they lack effective cache management capability. In order to solve these problems, we design an OPC UA multi-server aggregator with cache management, which enables centralized management of underlying data. Test results show that the proposed aggregator effectively improves the communication efficiency."
50,Conceptual Framework of Smart Factory Based on OPC UA and LSTM Encoder-Decoder,"OPC UA (Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture) is key for multi-heterogeneous software and hardware information integration. Some studies have proposed to apply OPC UA to smartfactory information integration, but most tend to propose concepts and lack application research. While, LSTM Encoder-Decoder (Long Short-Term Memory based Encoder-decoder) is an unsupervised learning method not requiring labeled data. It has good performance in time series data analysis, but few researches relate it with smart factory predictive analysis. This paper proposed a conceptual framework of smart factory based on OPC UA and LSTM Encoder-Decoder technology. Specifically, first, the theories are discussed including the general architecture of smart factory, information integration architecture based on OPC UA and LSTM Encoder-decoder model for smart factory predictive analysis. Then, we introduced the simulation result analysis. Finally, the conclusion was given."
51,Design and Implementation of the Substation Intelligent Auxiliary Control System Based on OPC UA,"At present, the traditional substation auxiliary control system is faced with the following four problems: poor real-time capability to abnormal response, high dependence on people when solving malfunctions, the communication, deployment and expansion of different underlying devices, and the lack of security mechanism. To solve these problems or optimize the functions, an intelligent substation auxiliary control system is proposed. The system innovatively applies OPC UA to the construction of the auxiliary control system. First, through the use of OPC UA's unique object-oriented modeling method as well as the joint specification modeling of OPC UA and IEC61850, to solve the data communication problems caused by heterogeneous devices. Second, applying the Client/Server mode to realize the remote access from authorized mobile clients and give instructions, to cope with abnormal conditions, which reduces the dependency on people. Clients of other authorized enterprises are allowed to access the working data of the devices they are interested in, makes full use of massive data and ensures the information security of the system. Third, Pub/Sub mode is applied to enable the underlying devices to communicate directly with each other through the middleware, which reduces the response time of equipment joint debugging and improve the real-time performance. In addition, through OPC UA, the industrial data of the system can be transmitted over the Internet, realizing the combination of the Internet of Things and the Internet, which is an idea of the combination of the two in the future."
52,Cross-Platform Device Monitoring System Based on OPC UA,"With the development of data monitoring system for industrial equipment, the convenience of data monitoring is paid more and more attention. Traditional data monitoring mostly uses specialized software or visual interface on the device to achieve the purpose of monitoring data, the workflow will be more complex. Even if there is a unified device to receive the data, it is not realistic to monitor all the time. In addition, for the load problem of the micro device, mounting the OPC UA client by itself is heavy. Therefore, in order to improve the visibility of field device data, reduce the load of micro devices and simplify the complex workflow, this paper studies the cross-platform device monitoring system based on OPC UA. The local OPC UA server is used to collect data from industrial devices, and the collected data is processed and transferred to the cloud storage system. The stateless RESTful HTTP request style simplifies the complexity of implementing data transfer between a generic client (browser or other HTTP client) and a Web server, and truly enables users to monitor data anytime and anywhere without consuming too many resources."
64,Implementation of a Bi-Directional Digital Twin for Industry 4 Labs in Academia: A Solution Based on OPC UA,"With the increased demands of smarter manufacturing approaches around the world, the process of industrial digital transformation is being pushed in and by both industry and academia. Learning factories and testing laboratories have been developed for decades for teaching and training purposes in Academia. Nowadays, as the future trend in industry, Industry 4 is being merged into the latest development of learning factories and testing laboratories. This paper presents the development and implementation of a bi-directional digital twin application in an Industry 4 testing laboratory at University of South Australia. The solution is based on the establishment of OPC UA connection between two cobots of different brands, the use of NX Siemens as a CAD simulation platform and a SCADA system from Inductive Automation. Due to differences between system interfaces, communication between different modules was challenging. Python OPC UA servers were developed. The digital twin replicates the physical system and is driven by inputs from the assembly cell."
66,Research and application of information Model of industrial Robot Welding System based on OPC UA,"As is known to all, industrial robot welding system in the intelligent manufacturing workshop plays An increasingly important role. In order to build an advanced industrial robot welding system and make it more intelligent, this paper proposed an information modeling scheme of industrial robot welding system based on OPC UA. The application of OPC UA information modeling technology in industrial robot welding system is conducive to the standardization and unification of different equipment interface protocols and the improvement of data transmission efficiency. This technology can be extended to the allconnected manufacturing platform, greatly reducing the manufacturing cost and realizing the all-dimensional interconnection of everything."
68,Node-Red and OPC UA Based Lightweight and Low-Cost Historian with Application in the Water Industry,"In the context of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), the interoperation of structures and the OPC UA interfacing is of high importance for automation and SCADA systems. Besides process monitoring and control, the historian concept is gaining more and more importance when data circulates vertically and horizontally on automation and supervisory levels. The specificity of the water industry requires a decentralized historian that is able to handle particular needs of local processes. The current work proposes a lightweight and low-cost historian that is applicable on both automation and SCADA levels. The solution consists of a main Java application that embeds the Node-red platform for interfacing with local structures and implements the OPC UA protocol. The developed historian is tested on objectives from the water industry. A water treatment plant test scenario is presented, the results proving the effectiveness of the solution."
71,A Hybrid Communication Framework Based Remote Management Architecture with OPC UA Information Model Construction,"Cloud manufacturing aims to carry out large-scale collaborative production through remote equipment management. To improve management efficiency, it is necessary to construct a unified information model and an adaptive communication framework for manufacturing lines with heterogeneous (high reliable/ low load) needs. OPC UA has become a prominent solution for remote configuration with extensible information models and various transport mechanisms. However, the existing solutions based on OPC UA focus on the information model and communication framework for the machine level, which is hard to support efficient remote management of the production line. In this paper, we construct the model of the process and parameter information in production-line level with a unified manner, which enables unified scheduling, configuration, and monitoring. The operational data are modeled hierarchically to reduce the amount of data transmission during monitoring. The hybrid communication framework is designed by integrating the Client-Server and PubSub models with edge assistance, which is to meet the heterogeneous communication requirements. We implement the management architecture on the physical platform to verify the performance. The experiments show that our architecture is suitable for remote configuration in terms of the combined performance of packet loss rate and CPU load with a massive connection."
75,Towards an OPC UA Compliant Programming Approach with Formal Model of Computation for Dynamic Reconfigurable Automation Systems,"This paper proposes Service Oriented SystemJ - OPC UA (SOSJ - OPC UA), a service-oriented programming approach which targets dynamic industrial manufacturing systems. An extension of SOSJ, SOSJ - OPC UA utilizes OPC UA standard to introduce service orientation, enable interoperability with different actors in the systems, and compliance with Reference Architecture Model for Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) which defines OPC UA as the communication standard. The paper begins by describing new concept on the synergy of SOSJ and OPC UA. Then, SOA information exchange mechanisms which utilize OPC UA are defined that enable parties to find each other. SOSJ - OPC UA is then demonstrated in a simple manufacturing example to demonstrate its capability."
76,Automated OPC UA address space generation from existing data structures,"If existing communication systems are converted to OPC UA, an OPC UA information model is required for the existing data structures. In small systems, an information model can be created manually with reasonable effort. In systems with numerous data structures, however, the effort for manual creation is too demanding. In order to continue using the existing data structures in the code without having to handle OPC UA-specific data structures, a transformation between the existing data structures and the OPC UA information model is necessary. This article presents a possibility of generating an OPC UA information model by a description of the existing data structures, e.g. generated based on ROS messages. The description of data structures is evaluated at runtime and linked with the existing data structures. The different representations for the different access types (read, request/response) in the OPC UA information model are discussed. In addition, an OPC UA client can read the information model from the descriptions of the data structures and write the read data back to the original data structure. In this way, both the provision of the data via OPC UA and the reception are possible. The adaptation effort of the existing software is minimal, since the existing structures are automatically populated and can still be used as usual."
79,OPC UA based Universal Edge Gateway for Legacy Equipment,"The objective of this study was to propose universal edge gateway that can transfer information of various legacy equipment conveniently and cost effectively to IT system for smart factory. The proposed universal edge gateway converts information from various legacy equipment used at the manufacturing site to OPC UA protocol. Also, ISA 95 information model was applied to realize the same equipment interface for all IT systems, including MES and ERP. It also includes hardware that can connect additional sensors, required for legacy equipment and configuration tools that allow operators to use simple gateways without modifying the equipment. As a result, in IT systems, it is possible to access the information of legacy equipment easily with the same interface, and to reduce the cost and time for building smart factory."
81,OPC UA Aggregation Server in the Fog,"Adopting the Fog computing paradigm in traditional Cloud infrastructures reduces latency and optimizes network consumption between data providers and data consumers because the system processes the data closer to its source. However, interoperability issues remain as heterogeneous and distributed data sources with different information models must be accessed for performing Cloud-level processing and analysis. This paper describes an integration architecture based on the OPC UA Aggregation Server paradigm, which introduces Fog-level data processing in industrial automation environments. The proposed architecture allows the creation of a configurable aggregated address space at Fog-level where information from data sources at Edge-level is integrated and served to consumers at Cloud-level. The architecture was tested both to verify that the functional requirements are met, and to analyse the time costs involved in the aggregation of Edge-level servers."
82,Implementation of Distributed Smart Factory Platform based on Edge Computing and OPC UA,"IoT (Internet of Things) is a core technology of hyper connected society that connects and interacts with all things, spaces and environments in the real world. Recently, IoT has evolved into edge computing technology that enhances data processing and analysis by decentralizing the computing power that was performed in the central cloud to an end device. Since edge computing is a structure suitable for a manufacturing environment requiring real-time processing of data and fast response, many studies have considered edge computing as an optimized platform technology for constructing a smart factory. Therefore, we design and implement a distributed smart factory platform for application to the factory environment based on the distributed architecture of edge computing. The proposed platform uses the data communication mechanism based on OPC UA standard to support M2M interaction between distributed edge devices. The implementation results are applied to the smart factory test bed, which is constructed through a preliminary study for applicability verification."
88,Applying Skill-based Engineering using OPC-UA in Production System with a Digital Twin,"The increasing demand for flexibility in the production industry has brought the need for plug and produce systems, in which components from various vendors and suppliers can be easily integrated into the production plant and without a lot of effort on the ground-level these components can be controlled. This paper proposes a novel engineering approach, combining the IEC 61499 component-based organisation of software with high-level command interface, known as skills, communicated between the components via OPC-UA. The approach is illustrated on a laboratory-scale flexible assembly system, composed of pneumatic jacks, mechatronic conveyors, robots and AGV's. The proposed platform demonstrates the ease of improving flexibility in the production scenarios."
97,Information Modeling of Cyber-Physical Systems using OPC-UA,"Achieving interoperability is a great challenge in the area of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) because of the specificities of these systems, which are complex distributed systems, mostly in the form of systems of systems that are an intersection of information and operational technologies with emergent behavior, acting in different time scales, with different granularities and accuracies, interacting with the operating environment. The main purpose of the research is to propose an information model for the development of service-oriented CPSs using OPC UA and generate sub-models for the Asset Administrative Shell (ASS). CPSs are multi-layered, service-oriented, and agent-based systems that enable the grouping of system elements at levels, reduce connections between modules, facilitate abstractions, and allocate responsibilities. The proposed approach is illustrated by an example of improving the interoperability of a pilot batch reactor."
98,RPC-Based OPC-UA Agent for Legacy PLCs,"This paper proposes an agent for OPC unified architecture (UA) that enables UA information service and client functions in legacy programmable logic controllers (PLC). The agent runs on a separate machine connected to the PLC using a dedicated link and maintains shared memory with the PLC. Based on the synchronized variables, the agent provides information models and executes client function blocks on behalf of the PLC. One important design feature is that the agent uses synchronized variables to implement a simplified remote procedure call (RPC) mechanism that conforms to the IEC 61131-3 functional model. This allows standard OPC-UA client functions to be used in existing PLC programs that only support numeric types and do not support strings or complex structures."
100,Standalone OPC UA Wrapper for Industrial Monitoring and Control Systems,"OPC unified architecture (UA), a communication standard for the manufacturing industry, enables exchanging control and management data among distributed entities in industrial automation systems. OPC UA wrapper is a migration strategy that provides UA clients with seamless access to legacy servers having OPC classic interfaces. This paper presents the design of a standalone OPC UA wrapper and discusses its performance through extensive experiments using a prototype implementation. The wrapper consists of two main components, i.e., UA server and classic client, which communicate with each other via shared memory and semaphore. One important feature of the design is that it employs a distributed component object model runtime library implemented in Java for platform independence. This makes it possible to build a cost-competitive wrapper system by using commercial off-the-shelf non-Windows solutions with low-cost microprocessors. Another key feature is the event-driven update interface between the UA and classic components, which we propose as an alternative to the sampling-based mechanism for the reduced delay. Through experiments using workloads from an industrial monitoring system, we present a systematic approach of identifying the system parameters having a direct impact on the wrapper performance and eventually tuning them such that the read and subscription services of OPC UA exhibit the best performance."
102,Automated Reasoning and Knowledge Inference on OPC UA Information Models,"The fourth industrial revolution demands flexibility, adaptability, transparency and semantic interoperability. Within the German Industry 4.0 initiative, the Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI4.0) has recently been standardized and OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) is listed as the sole recommendation for implementation of a communication layer. Even though OPC UA helps bridge the interoperability gap at the automation level, its semantic has not yet been formally defined and an efficient automated reasoning and knowledge inference on the OPC UA address space is therefore not yet possible. This paper addresses this issue by presenting a solution to infer knowledge from OPC UA information models. By analyzing and comparing the semantic expressiveness of the OPC UA address space with semantic knowledge representation formalisms such as RDF and OWL, we derived and implemented a solution to transform an OPC UA information model into an RDF-Graph expressing an OWL Ontology. Using the generated ontology, we were able to run a true reasoning task directly on the OPC UA address space. In this paper, the developed approach is conveniently validated on various case studies involving online factory reconfiguration, intelligent energy management, and human-machine interfaces."
108,Industrial data-collector by enabling OPC-UA standard for Industry 4.0,"Industrial Communication Systems have become an increasingly essential part of factory automation, motion control, networked control systems. New and real-time capable solutions are required to support the always more present Industry 4.0 paradigm: for both local and wide area networks. At the same time, standardization has also started moving in this direction: in particular, for future open and dynamic system architectures, promising activities based on OPC-UA are serious attempt to satisfy stricter requirements for interoperability and information modeling with hard real-time needs. For these reasons, in this paper the development of an OPC-UA based architecture is described: the main target is to build a â€œcollectorâ€ able to collect data from the shop-floor and convert them in the OPC-UA standard for an agile and effective vertical integration. The subsequent analysis carried out on the testbed mainly focuses on the performance evaluation of the method. To achieve high-performance data transmission in a fair environment, a parallel communication mechanism has been proposed."
111,Ontology-Based OPC UA Data Access via Custom Property Functions,"Cyber Physical Production Systems have a need of sharing and interlinking information and knowledge over different domains. In the area of industrial automation, OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) is a widely used and established standard for communication and information modeling. We propose an ontology-based OPC UA data access method utilizing custom property functions, which enables interlinking between OPC UA information and other factory data. To avoid duplicated data and to reduce the communication overhead in the proposed method, the OPC UA run-time data are loaded on-demand and are not persistently stored in the triplestore. To enable fast and easy ontology-based access and interlinking of the OPC UA information, the needed ontology is automatically generated from the OPC UA information model. A proof of concept demonstrates the application of our approach for a laboratory use-case of a Packed-Bed Regenerator."
116,An OPC UA PubSub Implementation Approach for Memory-Constrained Sensor Devices,"Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA) comprises 14 specifications to deploy an industrial system with reliability, security, and interoperability. While realizing this standard, the devices of the considering industrial system must have enough capabilities in computation and storage. It is a challenge in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), a scenario in which field-level devices can be memory-constrained sensor devices. Tailoring OPC UA to fit such devices requires advanced programming skills; otherwise, system developers must simplify or remove some essential features of OPC UA. This paper presents another implementation approach to tailor OPC UA PubSub, a specification for the publish-subscribe messaging pattern, into memory-constrained sensor devices. This approach, titled OPC UA PubSub-C, proposes using a remote OPC UA server as a configurator to operate large-memory-footprint tasks for field-level devices."
118,Generation of OPC UA Companion Specification with Eclipse Modeling Framework,"Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA) is a relevant technology in the field of machine-to-machine communication that defines data transport protocols and standardizes information modeling. Instead of defining a generalized world model, domain-specific models enable interoperability. These domain-specific models can be developed and released as Companion Specifications. More than 40 Companion Specifications are currently in development or already released. In this paper the current approaches to generate an OPC UA information model or an OPC UA Companion Specification are analyzed. A new modeling tooling based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) is presented. This tooling demonstrates the potential of a model-driven approach for the creation of the information model and the structured part of the descriptive text document of a Companion Specification."
119,Quarry: An open source tool for OPC UA SPARQL queries over hybrid architectures using query rewriting,"OPC UA is an open set of specifications for communication and modelling that have found extensive use in industrial automation. OPC UA information models are part of the specification and are used by asset owners and equipment vendors to describe the static parameters and time varying signals belonging to equipment in standardized ways. Such descriptions are aimed to drastically reduce the cost of integrating software managing these industrial assets. Hindering the adoption of OPC UA information models is their inherent complexity and the problematic specification of query support. Previous research has implemented the OPC UA query specification using SPARQL and found that formulating queries in SPARQL natively provides shorter queries that are easier to formulate. However, parts of the OPC UA graph are time-varying, and may index large time series data sets, which are sub-optimally handled by most available SPARQL databases. We show how OPC UA can be mapped to the Semantic Web in a way that allows a hybrid approach where time series data is stored in a specialized system and describe a query rewriting approach that allows for joint queries over static OPC UA information models and time series data. Compared to existing approaches, we argue that our approach is better suited for analytics applications that require portability across infrastructure and allows a greater range of SPARQL engines. A prototype implementation called Quarry is open sourced under the Apache 2.0 license to improve the accessibility and reproducibility of this research area."
126,Research and Implementation of Publish/Subscribe Communication Model Based on OPC UA,"In recent years, intelligent manufacturing has developed rapidly. Industrial IoT technologies are applied to different industrial scenarios. OPC UA is a service-oriented architecture, which has good interoperability. At the same time, it is a cross-platform communication standard that can realize the interconnection between heterogeneous network devices and solve the problem of information silos in the industrial IoT field. However, with the gradual increase of industrial equipment, the amount of data transmission in the network is increasing. The traditional OPC UA communication method based on client/server mode has defects such as tight coupling and performance bottleneck. It cannot meet the high throughput demand of the network. Therefore, these phenomena lead to longer time delays and lower transmission efficiency of network communication systems. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a publish/subscribe communication model based on OPC UA. We design the overall architecture of the OPC UA publish/subscribe model and adopt a message agent mechanism to realize distributed communication of OPC UA. This model has functions such as message modeling, address space construction, and publish/subscribe. The architecture of this communication model is compatible with the C/S model, which can ensure compatibility and coexistence with the traditional OPC UA communication system. Meanwhile, in order to improve the distinguished service capability of the OPC UA system, a multi-priority data scheduling algorithm is proposed and integrated into the publish/subscribe communication model to improve the efficiency of real-time data transmission in industrial networks. The experimental results show that the communication model can accomplish distributed communication in industrial networks and be better applied in wireless sensor networks. The scheduling algorithm included in the model significantly improves the efficiency of real-time data transmission and reduces the time delay."
128,Implementing OPC-UA services for Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems in Service-Oriented Architecture,"Industrial cyber-physical systems are advancing rapidly along with the emergence of the fourth industrial revolution. It is, therefore, necessary to design and develop appropriate tools and frameworks that allow the migration/integration of legacy systems into the new Industry 4.0 environment. OPC-UA is one of the recommended technologies to enable communication and interoperability of digitalized assets in Industry 4.0. This paper proposes a solution to develop an OPC-UA interface for industrial systems for service-oriented architecture. With the use of the Arrowhead Framework - a cloud-based framework facilitating interoperability and integrability of Industrial Internet of Things - and Industry 4.0-compliant technologies, the authors describe the procedure of developing different application systems which dynamically produce and consume OPC-UA services within a local automation cloud."
131,OPC UA PubSub Implementation and Configuration,"OPC UA (Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture) is one of the most widely used specifications for industrial system communication. In the context of increasingly complex technologies of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and requirements for interoperability of the Industrie 4.0, the specification is extended by adding a new communication architecture named PubSub to provide asynchronous information exchange capability. This paper introduces our OPC UA PubSub and MQTT based configuration tool, and a PubSub implementation that can be easily integrated into other C/C++ OPC UA projects."
135,Real-Time Communication Model Based on OPC UA Wireless Network for Intelligent Production Line,"With the continuous development of intelligent manufacturing technology, the intelligent production line for the Industrial Internet of Things occupies an important position in the field of industrial intelligence. OPC UA is a standard for communication data exchange between intelligent production line devices. OPC UA can establish a unified information model for production line devices and improve the connectivity of heterogeneous networks. However, in industrial wireless network application scenarios, there are various types of sensing information and large amounts of data to be transmitted. Each type of data has different requirements for real-time. The traditional OPC UA communication method is difficult to achieve real-time and reliable transmission in intelligent production lines and canâ€™t meet the transmission requirements of time-sensitive data. In this paper, we propose a real-time communication model of the OPC UA wireless network for intelligent production lines (UAMPDS). IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH is used as the wireless communication infrastructure, and OPC UA protocols are fused to this model. Meanwhile, we design a load-aware time-slot scheduling algorithm to dynamically allocate and schedule time slots according to the network topology and traffic load of each node. We also implement a dynamic preemptive resource scheduling strategy based on service differentiation to ensure real-time transmission of time-sensitive data. The experimental results show that this model achieves differentiated services based on data with different latency tolerance and effectively reduces the transmission latency of real-time service data under the constrained network resources. It can avoid the starvation phenomenon of low priority queues, and improves the overall quality of service of intelligent production line communication networks."
136,Leveraging Relational Database for Fast Construction of OPC UA Information Model,"With the development of manufacturing factory, massive devices are being deployed in production lines for performance monitoring and optimization, which raises the challenge of interconnectivity and interoperability among devices. OPC UA is widely recognized as one of the effective technologies to address such an issue. Traditional ways of constructing OPC UA information model need to manually add and define different nodes describing the devices and their attributes (e.g., names, ID, data types, etc.), which is costly and time-consuming when a huge number of devices is involved. Some works defined mapping rules between existing data model/structure/exchange format and OPC UA information model to reduce the workloads. However, they ignored the construction process of OPC UA information model and assumed that the existing referenced data structure/exchange format was created before the transformation of information model. Also, the mapping rules do not provide detailed implementation of mapping method. In this paper, we take the first attempt on the fast construction process of OPC UA information model. The raw data of field devices represented as structured data in rational database is fully utilized to extract the information, even though there are no existing data model for reference. The challenge of transforming structured data in database to OPC UA address space is discussed, based on which we propose a specific fast construction method for OPC UA information model. The method is deployed in the built industrial discrete manufacturing production line platform to evaluate the applicability of fast information model construction."
137,A toolchain for testing OPC UA interfaces,"Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA) is an increasingly important standard for industrial communication, which brings up the need for testing. Still, functional or formal verification of the implementation relies on conformance testing or custom solutions. Model-based testing has been studied and applied for decades, targeting many different technologies. OPC UA already provides a defined serialization format for its interfaces, representing a simple model of the application that could be utilized for testing.In this paper, we present our work on applying model-based testing to OPC UA server applications using the serialized interface description as the model. We introduce a possible toolchain for that approach and, based on that, discuss the possibilities and shortcomings of the interface description as a model for testing."
140,Non-Invasive Control Solution inside Higher-Level OPC UA based Wrapper for Optimizing Groups of Wastewater Systems,"Interoperability is a key attribute of systems nowadays in the industry. It enables local devices towards integration into higher-level supervisory/management structures and assures communication among same level systems. In the wastewater industry, local automation and SCADA structures are functioning independently in most situations and sometimes implemented using proprietary protocols causing higher-level integration and scalability/extensibility problems. With interdependences at the process level but without correlation in a higher-level supervisory algorithm, some real scenarios are causing undesired behaviors (e.g. wastewater overflows, untreated wastewater directed through bypasses into outlet). The current paper proposes a higher-level control solution (HLCS) that is modularly implemented inside a OPC UA based wrapper. The solution is designed for wastewater pumping stations and wastewater treatment plant to optimize their behavior as a group. Besides achieving interoperability of structures, the noninvasive character of the solution eliminates specific and frequent problems of interference in local functioning systems."
148,OPC UA Nodestore Switch - Usage Scenarios,"OPC Unified Architecture is one of the leading technologies to realize the horizontal and vertical communication from enterprise layer down to the field layer in automation technology. It defines an address space model consisting of nodes and references without specifying how to store these. Therefore, this paper first describes the concept of a nodestore and a nodestore switch. The core contribution of the nodestore switch is the decoupling of OPC UA servers from their node storage. Based on this, four usage scenarios demonstrate how to utilize the concept to address different requirements, like performance and persistence, the integration of domain specific (proprietary) meta models, the adaptation at runtime and sharing of information models. For each usage scenario a prototypical implementation is described to show an exemplary realization and to gather a deeper understanding of the usage."
151,Implicit Templates for Conformance Units in OPC UA Companion Specifications,"Due to its importance in the Industry 4.0 movement, the usage of OPC UA has increased in recent years. More and more vendor-independent and domain-specific models are developed as so-called Companion Specifications. OPC UA Profiles allow to subdivide functionality within the Companion Specifications, and thus offer flexibility to the standards. An OPC UA Profile is a set of individually testable entities called Conformance Units, which are also defined within the Companion Specification. In this work, similarities between Conformance Units defined by different working groups are analyzed and grouped in CU classes by the scope of the Conformance Units. For the most prevalent CU classes, textual templates are suggested, based on the typical formulations in existing Companion Specifications. These templates are intended to ease the development of Companion Specifications and the Conformance Units therein. The CU classes identified in this work suggest the templates can be used for more than two-thirds of the Conformance Units in a Companion Specification. The CU classes and templates are also a step towards automation in the generation of OPC UA Companion Specification Documents and test cases for the Conformance Units."
152,An Industrie 4.0 compliant and self-managing OPC UA Aggregation Server,"Gaining value out of data provided in industrial application in a standardized Industrie 4.0 compliant way is a challenging and time-extensive task. Not only does the data need to be integrated into a data platform, it also needs to be described and integrated in an appropriate way, that allows a standardized processing for its value-added services. One way to achieve this, lies in the use of OPC UA and the asset administration shell. Together they can implement an Industrie 4.0 Component as the standardized service for tailored data integration and usage. Data in OPC UA is available in different levels of abstraction, both in terms of the data and its description. Rarely is the asset administration shell (AAS) considered in this context. This paper will introduce a first approach to harmonize OPC UA and the AAS in an I4.0 compliant Aggregation Server. The server is able to aggregate information models based on the current meta model mapping of the AAS, regardless of whether the base servers implement this or not. Moreover the aggregated server can route OPC UA services down to the base servers and is managing itself in case of discovery and information aggregation. This approach can be used as the standalone interface for data integration in respective data platforms."
160,A Unified Method to Design Bridges for OPC UA PubSub Networks in the Industrial IoT,"Specification part 14 of the Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture (OPC UA) standard provides five different profiles to implement the publish-subscribe messaging pattern. The specification is also called OPC UA PubSub, and its profiles are called PubSub profiles. Two devices deployed with the same PubSub profile can exchange and collaborate; however, two devices deployed with two different PubSub profiles are unable to communicate. It is a limit for the Industry Internet of Things, a complex environment where there would be heterogeneous devices and networks. One approach to overcoming this issue is to use a bridge for the devices deployed with different PubSub profiles. In this sense, this paper provides a unified method to design bridges for OPC UA PubSub networks. The proof-of-concept experiment, also presented in this paper, is a use case of bridging PubSub broker-less and broker-based networks."
165,Skill-based Engineering and Control on Field-Device-Level with OPC UA,"The configuration of current automated production systems is complex and therefore time consuming while the market demands an easy setup and adaptability due to smaller batch sizes and volatile markets. While there are different concepts in research on how to simplify the engineering process by using generic skills or capabilities of devices, run-time control is still achieved with proprietary communication protocols and commands. The concept in this paper uses skills not only in the phase of engineering but also consequently for direct and generic control of field-devices. An executable skill-metamodel therefore describes the methodological functionality which is implemented by using OPC UA due to its vendor independence as well as built-in services and information model. The implementation uses client/server-based OPC UA and the pub/sub pattern to prepare for a deterministic real-time control in conjunction with TSN, which is required by industrial automation."
169,Charging Station Selection through the Analytic Hierarchy Process enabled by OPC-UA for Vehicle-to-Grid Communications,"During the last decade, the technologies related to the electric vehicles capture both the scientific and the industrial interest. In this context, the Smart Grid philosophy with the Vehicle-to-Grid concept poses a major role for the prevalence of the electric vehicles. Despite the presence of extended literature in the topic, the interoperability of different systems through well-adopted standards is still a challenge. Aiming to address this challenge and to support decision-making in a smart grid, this paper proposes a framework for the charging station selection in the case of electric vehicles. The framework employs the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Open Platform Communications-Unified Architecture (OPC-UA) standard. Specifically, the AHP is utilised to solve the multicriteria decision-making problem during the selection of the most appropriate charging station that will fulfil the needs of the electric vehicle driver. In addition, the OPC-UA enables the semantic modelling of the electric vehicle integrating all the interrelationships among the various subsystems and their components. As a result, a seamless information flow can be resulted among systems designed using different engineering disciplines (power electronics, mechanical, microelectronics, etc). The proposed framework is validated in the case study of a laboratory electric vehicle that is designed for urban transportations."
170,Multi-level modeling to OPC UA for migrating to Industry 4.0 in semiconductor manufacturing,"Semiconductor industry has long been active in standardization of interfaces to deal with interoperability. Even though these standards allow interoperability between different hosts and equipment within the semiconductor industry, it remains hard to make these interfaces interoperable with other domains of manufacturing. One of the main pillars of Industry 4.0 is the interoperability of different equipment and devices across multiple domains and between the operational and information technologies. Though OPC UA is becoming the de facto architecture for Industry 4.0, semiconductor equipment manufacturers need to comply with the existing SEMI standards to ensure the sales of their equipment. In this context, the primary goal of this work is to develop a comprehensive metamodel of the SEMI communication interfaces. As a secondary goal, we want to use this model to carry out a preliminary experimentation on using OPC UA as a communication architecture in semiconductor industry, maintaining maximum compliance to the established SEMI standards."
172,A Novel Smart Production Line Data Perception System Based on OPC UA,"With the rapid development of information and communication technology (ICT), traditional manufacturing is undergoing an upgrade and transformation to smart manufacturing. In order to achieve intelligent management and control of production process, data perception (DP) is the primary problem to be investigated during the transformation of current production line (PL). However, due to the numerous equipment types, heterogeneous communication protocols and interfaces, the cyber system and the physical world are severely separated, resulting in the phenomenon of information islands. In this paper, we propose a novel DP system architecture for smart production line (SPL) based on OPC UA, which is compatible with multiple device system protocols as well as provides a unified interaction interface for data-driven applications. Data collection and result feedback based on the protocol mapping and conversion are realized by flexibly utilizing two communication patterns of OPC UA, namely client-server (CS) and publish-subscribe (PubSub). The local and cloud case studies strongly verify the feasibility and prospect of the DP system."
175,Controller Interface for Industry 4.0 based on RAMI 4.0 and OPC UA,"The Fourth Industrial Revolution or Industry 4.0 (I4.0) represents the evolution of the current productive systems from the merge of industrial automation and informatics. The technical innovation of I4.0 is characterized by the integration of manufacturing systems, management over the product life cycle and the decentralization of computing resources. The Reference Architecture Model for Industry 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) defines the compatible elements of I4.0 in a three-dimensional layer model. Despite its acceptance, the use of RAMI 4.0 is still restricted to research institutions and cases of individual executions. This paper focuses on the development of an open source controller interface for I4.0 based on RAMI 4.0 and OPC UA protocol. This interface should provide the functionalities of programming, RFID identification, network communication and equipment supervision, providing real-time process information, in a standardized and interoperable way, for any type of platform connected to the network. The paper describes the integration of technologies in the controller interface, as well as the controller relationship to the RAMI 4.0 layers. In addition, this controller interface represents the first step towards the development of a compatible â€œcontrol deviceâ€ to support I4.0 applications."
176,Implementing an OPC UA interface for legacy PLC-based automation systems using the Azure cloud: An ICPS-architecture with a retrofitted RFID system,"Companies often have legacy systems within production processes. Many of these systems use proprietary information-communication-control-technologies (ICCT), among others, and for that reason it is difficult to integrate them into new industrial environments that require Industrie 4.0-compliances. The migration process of such industrial systems, i.e., retrofitting it into an Industrie 4.0-compliant, ICPS-Infrastructure, leads to the necessity of new features and components in the legacy architecture. This paper summarizes the process for retrofitting a flexible manufacturing system located at the Institute for Industrial Informatics, Automation and Robotics (I2AR) of the University of Applied Sciences Emden/Leer, integrating legacy PLCs, RFID and commercial cloud technology on the basis of an Industry 4.0-compliant digitalization of components with OPC UA interfaces. With the use of common technologies recommended for migrating legacy industrial systems into Industrie 4.0-compliant systems, the authors describe the major specifications and characteristics of a migration approach and resulted novel ICPS-architecture that allows the operator and/or other legacy automation and management systems to monitor and control the PLC component via a RAMI4.0-compliant digital interface, via a retrofitted RFID System."
178,From ISA 88/95 meta-models to an OPC UA-based development tool for CPPS under IEC 61499,"In the era of Industry 4.0, fast-growing requirements for an agile and effective vertical integration are challenging the smart manufacturing. Cyber-Physical Production System (CPPS) technology plays a key role in the Industry 4.0 factory. One of the reasons for this is that shop floor data collection, monitoring and processing are enabled by CPPS devices together with IEC 61499 standard. To this end modeling and developing software and hardware components focused on distributed control systems are provided. This improvement in data monitoring and processing results not only in an optimization of equipment predictive maintenance but also in the ability to integrate new control techniques. This approach provides the Oil&Gas industry with the foundation to transform their traditional production fields into Intelligent Oil Field (IOF) environments. The aim of this paper is to build bridges between the state of technology and the design of industrial control applications. In particular, a CPPS platform developed through a software engineering tool giving support to the design of applications is proposed. It is based on the IEC 61499 and on a configurable OPC-UA server that maps field device data into an ISA95/88-based information model. Thus, this proposal will not only save Oil&Gas engineer time, it also will save efforts of adopting this promising technology."
180,Design of a semantic information model for automated tape placement systems using OPC-UA,"Standardized and reliable interfaces for production machines are essential requirements for realizing fully automated manufacturing throughout the value chain. Especially the lightweight industry with its heterogeneous and interdependent process landscape will profit from such a standardized, semantic process and material description. This paper presents an approach for semantic modeling of the automated laser-assisted tape placement process with in-situ consolidation using the OPC UA information-modeling framework and realizes an exemplary implementation for an existing machine prototype."
181,Improving interoperability of Virtual Commissioning toolchains by using OPC-UA-based technologies,"It is well-known that one the most important challenges in industrial manufacturing processes is the reduction of lead-times and delays during the on-site commissioning. In applications in which several automation systems are used, such as in aeronautics or automotive manufacturing cells, several PLC's and drives are used to control the motion of the different electromechanical components. In order to verify and validate (V&V) automation code before deployment in the production environment, virtual commissioning (VC) techniques have become of great interest in the last decades. Even if VC simulation approaches, based on software/hardware-in-the-loop (SiL, HiL), have shown effectiveness to V&V automation code, the continuity from the execution to the simulation layers may not be ensured due to a lack of interoperability in the toolchain. Additionally, the development of reliable component models is a complex task of the VC solution since it requires a high level of mechatronics expertise. In order to avoid losing information between the execution and the simulation layers of VC toolchains, this paper presents a SiL based approach for interconnecting the PLC's with the VC simulation tool by means of OPC-UA-based technologies. In addition, in order to develop the functional models, we propose a library-based development. This will facilitate seamless flow of information between different PLC editors and the simulation layer. SiL simulations of the suggested approach on an automotive manufacturing cell are performed and show digital continuity from the execution to the simulation layer."
188,Collecting Data and Metadata by Transforming between Differently Expressive Query Languages,"Recent trends lead to an ever-increasing data availability while gathering and linking valuable metadata is still an open research topic. Most industrial applications use vendor-specific data access and extract metadata either hard-coded or not, mainly because the used communication protocols are fast but have limited expressiveness. More powerful and convenient query languages (QLs) exist but are not yet applied to these scenarios. This paper crosses that bridge by transforming queries formulated in highly expressive QLs into lower-expressive ones to enable flexible metadata access in existing setups. We apply our methodology to an POC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) application in manufacturing and implement an open-source mapping from the expressive QL XPath. We export OPC UA information models to XML, design XPath expressions, transform these to OPC UA, and finally execute them in OPC UA with a patched client. An evaluation in a real-world injection molding application demonstrates how we, in addition to raw sensor values, dynamically capture associated metadata such as unit, scale, and precision. Our approach replaces individual, machine-dependent solutions with universal ones that drastically reduce the time and complexity for experts and can be easily transferred to other machines."
189,Information model for the digital transformation of manufacturing systems in small and medium enterprises,"This article proposes the development of an information model that allows starting the digital transformation of a small or medium-sized company (SME) using the OPC UA protocol. The model is made up of a hardware component made up of the process plant and the control equipment, as well as a software component where the information model is implemented.As an application case, the proposed information model is developed in a unit process plant, a filtration plant. The process carried out in this plant is through a filter to remove the solid particles present in the water used in the manufacturing process of a beverage. This plant can be integrated into a beverage and/or soft drink manufacturing system in a small company.The information model is integrated into an OPC UA server, a programmable controller, mapping the process variables such as level, temperature flow, and energy consumption. The information of the technological elements that make up the filtration plant are: serial, manufacturer, and calibration dates: OPC UA clients request information from the OPC UA server and then they are sent through procedures (methods) defined in the server and consumed by the server. client, all this integrates the information model.The foregoing shows the viability of the proposed"
194,Cyber-Physical Production Systems supported by Intelligent Devices (SmartBoxes) for Industrial Processes Digitalization,"Industry 4.0 paradigm is a reality in the digitization of industrial processes and physical assets, as well as their integration into digital ecosystems with several suppliers of the value chain. In particular, Industry 4.0 is the technological evolution of embedded systems applied to Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). With this, a shift from the current paradigm of centralization to a more decentralized production, supported by Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), is implied. The work reported in this paper focuses on the development of smart devices (SmartBoxes), based on low-cost hardware such as Raspberry Pi and also platforms certified for industrial applications, such as NI CompactRIO. Both platforms adopted the OPC-UA architecture to collect data from the shop-floor and convert it into OPC-UA Data Access standard for further integration in the proposed CPPS. Tests were also performed with the MQTT protocol for monitorization. Each SmartBox is capable of real-time applications that run on OPC-UA and MQTT, allowing easy interaction between supervisory systems and physical assets."
199,"Semantic Automation Systems, a Suitable Approach for Automation Networks in the Industry 4.0","The Industry 4.0 demands a change of paradigm for the automation engineering and some new requirements that has to be accomplished like data integration, big data processing, semantics, communication protocols, and standardization. The interoperability is another essential concept, it is a key for the development of the Industry 4.0. This work presents a semantic approach to model automation systems through an ontology, and its applicability in industrial automation networks using OPC UA. The Automation I4.0 Ontology, the model proposed in this project, provides a semantic tool to represent high-, middle, and low-level concepts of automation systems, and offers a way to integrate directly in software applications and semantic-based communications protocols such as OPC UA. It demonstrates the suitability of the semantic-based automation systems to be implemented by semantic-based or object-based communication protocols in Industry 4.0 applications. This initiative intends to empower the development of the Industry 4.0 and the Internet of Things for the automation engineering."
200,Construction and Application of Information Model of CNC Machine Tools,"The Computer Numerical Control machine tools in the digital workshop usually come from different manufacturers, and it is difficult to transfer information between upper-level systems and heterogeneous devices, so it is necessary to establish a complete and standardized information model to realize the interconnection of device information. In this paper, we analyze the composition structure of machine tools and production operation information, and establish a flexible and scalable information model of CNC machine tools according to the modeling rules of manufacturing equipment integrated information model. By developing OLE for Process Control Unified architecture server, the mapping of information model to OPC UA information model is realized, and it is verified that the client can access the information of CNC machine tools by accessing the server. It shows that the established CNC machine tool information model can be interconnected based on OPC UA protocol."
209,Shop Floor Virtualization and Industry 4.0,"This paper addresses one of the key components in today's industrialization approach: virtualization. The work describes the virtualization of a typical production process, the digital twin in the scope of Industry 4.0, involving different devices, such as robotic arms, conveyors, automatic warehouses and vision systems. It includes both legacy and recent equipment, with different characteristics and communication capabilities, ranging from RS232 serial communication to TCPIIP-based communication, or even I/O-based interaction for devices with no communication capabilities. The developed approach aims at industrial implementations, while allowing for educational purposes. For a standardized approach, the OPC UA protocol is used for high-level communication between the various systems.

213,Function Blocks for the Interaction with the Asset Administration Shell,"An asset administration shell (AAS), as a key concept of the Industry 4.0, provides a machine-accessible interface to any kind of asset. An application implementing the devices functionality should be able to interact with different AASs.In this work, we specify the function blocks (FBs) for accessing properties and invoking operations of AASs. We analyzed the nature and requirements of such FBs while focusing on REST/HTTP- and OPC UA-based AASs and provided IEC 61499-based implementation.The results obtained in this paper will ease interaction with the complex AAS structure from the low-level devices."
214,The application of open access middleware for cooperation among heterogeneous manufacturing systems,"The vision behind industry 4.0 is to create even smarter manufacturing facilities. Industry 4.0 includes both hardware and software components, which are expected to seamlessly interact in a secure manner. Thus, machinery and software components from different manufacturers should be able to communicate in a common language. Such a challenge is typically met by introducing a â€œmiddlewareâ€ to serve as a joint communication platform. In this paper we discuss the use of OPC UA standard for communication between hardware and software components in a typical manufacturing system. Further we develop a digital twin and present an demonstration of our digital laboratory."
216,Noninvasive control solution for energy efficiency in wastewater treatment plants,"Improving energy efficiency in wastewater plants is an important goal for water distribution companies due to the high costs associated with wastewater treatment processes. Most of these costs are generated by the aeration process, respectively optimizing the oxygen control strategy and consequently affecting the ammonium and nitrate levels can lead to significant reduction in energy consumption. Most wastewater treatment plants are already implemented and functioning systems, respectively any interference in modifying invasively existing structures/algorithms is problematic. Following industrial internet of things principles in an Industry 4.0 context, the paper proposes an OPC UA client based model predictive control structure that will allow the solution development in a completely noninvasive manner for the functioning system. The solution is applied in a simulation environment with calibrated and validated model and using real input data. Also, a Node-red and Raspberry Pi platforms application is structured for future long-term testing and validation on real plant following the current research. The paper presents the results of current developments proving the efficiency of the concept."
217,Towards a Real-Time Capable Plug & Produce Environment for Adaptable Factories,"Industrial manufacturing is currently undergoing a transformation from mass production with inflexible production systems to individual production with adaptable cells. In order to ensure this adaptability of these systems, technologies such as plug & produce are needed, to integrate, modify and remove devices at runtime. Therefor an exact description of the system, the products and the capabilities / skills of the devices is essential as well as a network for communication between the devices. Deterministic data transmission is particularly important for distributed control systems. We propose an architecture for plug & produce mechanisms with hard real-time capable communication paths between the cyber-physical components using OPC UA PubSub over TSN and the ability to load and execute real-time critical tasks at runtime."
219,Workshop Management and Control System Based on Digital Twin,"Aiming at the connotation and characteristics of digital twin, and improving the level of informatization and intelligence of the workshop, a workshop management and control system based on digital twins is proposed, which can realize the management and control of the full life cycle of digital twins. Based on the physical production line model of the digital twin, the virtual and real joint debugging method of the digital twin workshop is constructed: the controller controls the virtual model, and the virtual model drives the simulation. The operation and control model of the digital twin is driven through the communication framework of OPC UA (Object Linking and Embedding for Process Unified Architecture), and the virtual and real interaction of the physical production line is used to timely reflect the operation of the workshop. From model building, model digital drive, virtual and real control joint debugging, to full life cycle workshop verification and design simulation, the visual monitoring of the digital twin workshop is finally realized."
220,On enhancing reconfigurability of I/O connection and access in lEC 61499,"The efficiency and flexibility of data connection establishment in the automation system development architecture of lEC 61499 is important to support portability and flexibility. To improve this aspect, this paper proposes a method integrating OPC UA functionalities and I/O-accessing capabilities, introducing two function blocks, SmartlX and SmartQX. The solution is illustrated with one use case and comparison with the existing solution. The comparison shows that our proposed solution can improve efficiency, flexibility and portability for lEC 61499 by making fewer changes to existing systems from debugging mode to production mode."
225,Towards Increased Flexibility and Interoperability in Distributed Process Control Applications,"The modern process automation plants are changing into flexible designs, which raises the requirements for distributively controlled logic, a high degree of interoperability, dynamic reconfiguration and software reusability. Thus, creating an opportunity to integrate the distributed control system standards and platform independent communication protocols. In this paper, we propose the use of OPC UA to increase interoperability of communication and the utilization of Arrowhead Framework to enhance interoperable service compositions of control applications implemented in IEC 61499. The concept is outlined for the integration and modeling of a distributed control system for a FESTO laboratory batch process system. A control application example is provided to create distributed control of Cyber-Physical Systems using services that are connected using IEC 61499 in accordance to Industry 4.0 for improved interoperability and flexibility."
230,A Unified Asset Management Architecture Based on OPC UA,"With the development of information technology, the demands for product specifications and customizations have attracted much attention in recent years. The traditional manufacturing systems struggle to face the fast-moving market conditions because they are specifically tailored in demand. To strengthen the flexibility and interoperability of the assets, Industry 4.0 (I4.0) proposes the concept of Asset Administration Shell (AAS), which provides digital representations for industrial assets. Although the content of AAS has been discussed from different perspectives, there is no standard implementation method for a general AAS currently. In this paper, we propose an AAS implementation method based on OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA), which realizes the virtualization of industrial assets and shields the underlying protocols. It simultaneously provides a solution to the interconnection and interoperability of industrial network devices. Furthermore, a hierarchical asset management architecture based on AAS is designed to improve the management of industrial assets, laying the foundation for flexible manufacturing."
233,Cloud-based Plug and Work architecture of the IIC Testbed Smart Factory Web,"The Smart Factory Web (SFW) is a platform that connects Smart Factories over a network to enable flexible sharing and management of resources, assets and inventory to maximize production and efficiency. In order to become part of the Smart Factory Web, network participants describe not only their products, but also the factory capabilities to order to improve factory-to-factory collaboration. A Smart Factory Web Portal (SFWP) enables secure data and service integration in cross-site application scenarios as well as `plug & work' functions for devices, machines, and data analytics software by applying industrial standards, Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA), and Automation Markup Language (AutomationML or AML for short). OPC UA serves as a comprehensive and secure communication protocol from the machine level into the cloud. A Cloud Coupler on the shop floor publishes the availability of a factory and selected process data in the SFWP. Customers or even smart machines can use this information to make decisions for placing an order and track their orders in real time. In order to simplify the setup of the connection to the cloud and minimize the commissioning time the cloud coupler also aggregates all OPC UA servers on devices in the factory into a single OPC UA aggregated server address space. In this paper an architecture is proposed which uses cloud coupler and plug and work techniques to make a new or retrofit factory available in a SFW to share capability information towards a new marketplace for manufacturing. It is shown that the integration efforts are decreased but also the use of standards reduces the effort to define interfaces."
239,"Supporting the Design, Commissioning and Supervision of Smart Factory Components through their Digital Twin","In a context of greater complexity of Smart Factories, the commissioning time for automated systems needs to be shortened. The use of virtual commissioning tools is a good contribution to achieve this goal. Ideally, those tools should be part of a virtual engineering environment sharing same virtual model, the digital twin, through the complete lifecycle of the automated system, namely the project, simulation, implementation and execution/monitoring/supervision and, eventually decommissioning phases. Such vision includes a digital twin with a broader use, which is consistent with the real system and one that can be used after the early design and commissioning phases. Finding a complete set of tools able to comply with the above requirements can be extremely challenging. In this paper we explore the use of the ABB RobotStudio software combined with the OPC UA standard with this vision in mind. Methodologies were defined to integrate both new generation and legacy equipment, as well as robot controllers and guidelines for equipment development. A key result of this work is the development of a set of virtual engineering tools and methodologies based on OPC UA and implemented using RobotStudio in order to accomplish the complete lifecycle support of an automated system, from the project and simulation phases, to the monitoring and supervision phases, suitable for integration in Industry 4.0 factories. Results are described for a test scenario with different devices."
244,Optimization of multi-agent auctioning processes in flexible production networks,"Shorter product lifecycles and increasing product complexity are important trends that drive the need for increased flexibility of production companies. One way to cope with this problem is to engage in flexible production networks where companies can find missing production capabilities and offer their own ones. To enable this connection across company borders and software platforms, an agent-based communication approach is proposed that is based on the OPC UA standard. This paper also develops an optimization concept that can increase a company's benefits, i.e. profits, by applying a learning algorithm as well as an approach to calculate optimal margins, which is encapsulated in an optimization agent."
257,Standardized communication systems for distributed energy resources in micro grids,"Micro grids often consist of energy generators, storages and consumers with controllers which are not prepared for their integration into communication networks for energy systems. In this paper it will be presented, how standards from the field of energy automation can be applied in such controllers. The data for communication interfaces can be structured according to the IEC 61850-or the VHPREADY-standard. It is investigated which requirements must be supported to implement such data models within the controllers. For the transmission of the data we propose the OPC UA protocol, which supports extensive security measures and which is today available for nearly all modern types of controllers and computers."
259,Learning-based Automatic Report Generation for Scheduling Performance in Time-Sensitive Networking,"As the global industrial upgrading requires higher reliability and real-time performance of data communication, Time-sensitive Networking (TSN) has been widely studied. Al-though many TSN scheduling algorithms are designed, there is no standardized analysis report after scheduling and comprehensive scheduling performance evaluation. This paper presents a complete automatic report generation system to analyze the scheduling performance. To standardize various data in TSN-based manufacturing, a uniform auto-generated report model is defined based on the Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture (OPC UA). A learning-based performance evaluation (LPE) method is established to comprehensively analyze the performance of TSN scheduling. In LPE, analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and entropy weight method (EWM) is adopted to optimize the weight distribution of performance indexes objectively, and convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to get the final evaluation result rapidly. Compared with the previous evaluation methods, simulations show the training time of the evaluation method is significantly reduced."
260,An Approach for Data Pipeline with Distributed Query Engine for Industrial Applications,"The data driven services in industrial automation systems are transforming the world of automation industry by optimizing industrial processes and providing Value Added Services (VASs) with the grace of Industry 4.0, Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI). A demand driven data pipeline is essential to connect different industrial data sources in a shop floor with different data storage systems for service provisioning. This paper analyzes an experimental approach and corresponding challenges to optimize computing resource allocation in industrial applications to construct such demand driven data pipeline to provide data driven services through an open source, flexible and extensible distributed query engine known as Presto, which can perform interactive analytical queries for different purposes such as condition monitoring, asset management or many others."
271,An approach for an industrial information model management,"An overall information model of an industrial cyberphysical system consists of different sub information models. These sub information models contain attributes and methods that describe parts of the overall information model such as a machine or an order. Every entity within a company has varying requirements in terms of information it needs to represent, or read from the information model. In contrary, especially in environments with a large number of system entities, it is necessary to standardize the information models as much as possible to optimize economic and performance potentials. To address this challenge this paper presents an approach for information model management. This is done via the creation of rules for information modelling and the forming of an enterprise specific information model library."
