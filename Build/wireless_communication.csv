13,An Evaluation of the Applicability of OPC UA Publish Subscribe on Factory Automation use Cases,"In today's factory automation the exchange of data between systems becomes more and more important. The goal is to use one communication technology through all levels of a factory automation. Now the challenge is to find a communication technology that fulfills all the requirements on the different levels. The Server/Client architecture used in OPC UA became the de facto standard for several use cases in the upper levels, but in the lower levels e.g. Control-to-Control and Field level, OPC UA wasn't performant enough to replace today's fieldbus technologies. Therefore the OPC Foundation extended OPC UA by a Publish Subscribe architecture which was released in March 2018 in the OPC UA Specification Part 14. This paper gives an overview of this specification and an evaluation of the applicability of OPC UA communication technologies in combination with Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) on factory automation use cases."
18,VSOMEIP - OPC UA Gateway Solution for the Automotive Industry,"The fourth industrial revolution is relying on interoperability and consequently on the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) concept. The industry is constantly researching and developing solutions for vertical and horizontal interoperation of systems, some concepts being already well-grounded. One of the main issues is the interfacing. The industry accepted the OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) protocol as of high importance for interoperability in the IIoT context. The automotive industry is considered to have a separate path, because of a somehow more rigid approach towards communication and data integration. But, car-to-infrastructure and even car-to-car communication are requiring data exchange and implicitly a newer approach from the automotive industry. Recently, VSOMEIP (Scalable service Oriented MiddlewarE over IP from Genivi) interfacing is more and more present in automotive, its main focus being to assure interoperation between the Electronic Control Units (ECUs). The current paper proposes a VSOMEIP - OPC UA gateway conceptual solution that assures car interfacing in the IIoT context. The proof of concept is implemented regarding AUTOSAR (Automotive Open System Architecture) requirements, using a tailored operating system on an embedded device. In the first case study, the gateway is tested having all OPC UA and VSOMEIP clients and servers implemented and functioning on the device. The second case study presents the connection to an external OPC UA server. The obtained results are proving the effectiveness of the concept."
28,Construction of Industrial Internet of Things Based on MQTT and OPC UA Protocols,"At present, the Internet of Things has become a hot area of global concern and is considered to be another major scientific and technological innovation after the Internet. The Internet of Things can be analyzed from two aspects, one is to access the Internet, and the other is the connection between things. The Industrial Internet of Things, as a new type of industrial ecosystem, collects resources and data during the industrial production process by using miniature low-cost controllers and high-bandwidth wireless networks to achieve flexible configuration of manufacturing raw materials and improve resource utilization. The Industrial Internet of Things not only includes traditional software elements, but also requires hardware controllers and sensors, as well as cloud service platforms, to ultimately achieve intelligent manufacturing. The Industrial Internet of Things based on MQTT adopts the method of upper computer (WeChat applet) + server (Alibaba Cloud Server) + lower computer (WiFi module ESP8266 NodeMcu) to realize data collection and control of industrial production process. Based on OPC UA protocol, The Industrial Internet of Things, by designing an intelligent node device based on embedded Linux system, uses Qt to build the OPC UA protocol. OPC UA is a C / S architecture real-time database framework. By building an OPC UA Client on a handheld terminal device, An OPC UA Serve is set up on the smart terminal device, and the information collected by the handheld terminal is sent to the smart terminal. At the same time, multiple smart terminals are connected through the OPC UA protocol to perform data interaction and information transfer. At the same time, an edge computing algorithm is embedded in the smart terminal, and a large amount of data collected is processed for analysis, screening, and calculation. At the same time, the processed information is transmitted or processed. Reduce data interactions between data sources and data centers, and reduce the amount of information transmitted and stored."
33,Towards an Industrial Converged Network with OPC UA PubSub and TSN,"Technologies such as TSN and OPC UA are enablers for converged networks in industrial applications. TSN enables the coexistence of network traffic with real-time requirements and best-effort requirements. On the other hand, OPC UA defines a common information model in addition to secure communication, scalability, and platform independence. The new specification of OPC UA PubSub enables the possibility of implementing OPC UA on the lower levels of the automation pyramid, the field level. Therefore, combining these two technologies can in principle be implemented for every vertical and horizontal communication. This document analyzes the state of the art of OPC UA over TSN and explains the first steps towards an easy to use proof-of-concept for a converged network that is also designed to be a testbed. The testbed will be used to evaluate the interoperability of TSN-capable devices from different vendors. In addition to that, different OPC UA PubSub implementations will be used and benchmarked. These future results will present an overview of the currently available products and provides hands-on experiences for practical implementations of converged networks."
34,Overview of OPC UA TSN,"Ethernet has become a very extensive communication protocol standard for the intercommunication and connection of enterprises, homes and even data center networks. However, with the rapid development of network technology and the expansion of vertical industry applications, at the data transmission level, there will be higher requirements for the certainty, real-time, and reliability of network transmission. The traditional Ethernet channel access method is based on competition, and cannot meet the real-time requirements of various industries. The OPC UA TSN combination emerges spontaneously. The communication network provided by this combination is not only highly deterministic and real-time, but more importantly, it realizes the true independence of the communication network from equipment manufacturers, in terms of network security, bandwidth, interoperability, synchronization, and delay. It has brought huge improvements. It has to be said that the OPC UA TSN combination is the best partner for establishing a comprehensive network between the sensor and the cloud."
43,TSN Traffic Shaping for OPC UA Field Devices,"This paper extends research on TSN enablement for OPC UA field devices, comparing the impact of credit-based and time-aware traffic shapers. Despite conceptual difference, these traffic shaping methods can provide similar bandwidth reservation for high priority traffic. The two shapers are superposed with varying traffic limitations to assess the timing characteristics of the OPC UA data exchange using a resource-constrained field device."
69,Deterministic Communication Based on TSN and OPC UA Embedded Server,"With the development trend of industry 4.0 and intelligent manufacturing, industrial automation systems will tend to be unified and standardized solutions. Based on meeting the industrial communication requirements, the data access, function realization, and so on in the industrial system are required to be unified as far as possible. At present, a more mature solution is the combination of TSN and OPC UA, which is expected to simplify the integration and management of complex multi-vendor automation systems. This paper studies one aspect, the standardized and deterministic access to industrial field data based on TSN and OPC UA embedded server."
71,A Hybrid Communication Framework Based Remote Management Architecture with OPC UA Information Model Construction,"Cloud manufacturing aims to carry out large-scale collaborative production through remote equipment management. To improve management efficiency, it is necessary to construct a unified information model and an adaptive communication framework for manufacturing lines with heterogeneous (high reliable/ low load) needs. OPC UA has become a prominent solution for remote configuration with extensible information models and various transport mechanisms. However, the existing solutions based on OPC UA focus on the information model and communication framework for the machine level, which is hard to support efficient remote management of the production line. In this paper, we construct the model of the process and parameter information in production-line level with a unified manner, which enables unified scheduling, configuration, and monitoring. The operational data are modeled hierarchically to reduce the amount of data transmission during monitoring. The hybrid communication framework is designed by integrating the Client-Server and PubSub models with edge assistance, which is to meet the heterogeneous communication requirements. We implement the management architecture on the physical platform to verify the performance. The experiments show that our architecture is suitable for remote configuration in terms of the combined performance of packet loss rate and CPU load with a massive connection."
81,OPC UA Aggregation Server in the Fog,"Adopting the Fog computing paradigm in traditional Cloud infrastructures reduces latency and optimizes network consumption between data providers and data consumers because the system processes the data closer to its source. However, interoperability issues remain as heterogeneous and distributed data sources with different information models must be accessed for performing Cloud-level processing and analysis. This paper describes an integration architecture based on the OPC UA Aggregation Server paradigm, which introduces Fog-level data processing in industrial automation environments. The proposed architecture allows the creation of a configurable aggregated address space at Fog-level where information from data sources at Edge-level is integrated and served to consumers at Cloud-level. The architecture was tested both to verify that the functional requirements are met, and to analyse the time costs involved in the aggregation of Edge-level servers."
82,Implementation of Distributed Smart Factory Platform based on Edge Computing and OPC UA,"IoT (Internet of Things) is a core technology of hyper connected society that connects and interacts with all things, spaces and environments in the real world. Recently, IoT has evolved into edge computing technology that enhances data processing and analysis by decentralizing the computing power that was performed in the central cloud to an end device. Since edge computing is a structure suitable for a manufacturing environment requiring real-time processing of data and fast response, many studies have considered edge computing as an optimized platform technology for constructing a smart factory. Therefore, we design and implement a distributed smart factory platform for application to the factory environment based on the distributed architecture of edge computing. The proposed platform uses the data communication mechanism based on OPC UA standard to support M2M interaction between distributed edge devices. The implementation results are applied to the smart factory test bed, which is constructed through a preliminary study for applicability verification."
89,An OPC UA-based Crane Model Using Time-Sensitive Networking Technology,"Current control processes in the material handling domain are generally not automated but require manual human intervention. However, the ongoing development towards the Industry 4.0 involves new models and concepts and hence more and more automated control functions will become necessary. That is, devices such as cranes in the material handling domain will become smarter and will also be networked to a larger extent. However, it will be required that control messages passed to the cranes through a network, possibly shared with other traffic, are guaranteed to arrive in time. In this paper, we present an OPC UA-based model of an overhead travelling crane as part of a material handling scenario. The crane can be controlled by a crane remote controller, which we model as well. We use time-sensitive networking technology to ensure deterministic communication between the crane remote controller and the crane. To demonstrate the crane movement, we illustrate it in a simulation before we prove the deterministic communication in a real testbed."
114,Applying Event-Based Sending Intervals to Enable Low Energy OPC-UA on Sensor Nodes,"Integrating typical wireless sensors into industrial control systems is a crucial task to realize the full potential of the Industrial Internet of Things (IoT). Many lightweight protocols exist for the use in the IoT context with a focus on energy efficient data transmissions. Industrial protocols on the other hand ensure reliable and timely transfer of data but typically at the cost of a higher energy consumption. In this paper, we analyze and compare one protocol from each category to determine the different energy consumption and then evaluate how different sending schemes can enhance the energy consumption of the industrial protocol. The goal is to reduce the energy consumption while keeping the relevant information under industrial constraints and enabling tuning to different scenarios. Our results show that these goals are achievable by applying event-based sending approaches. However, a good understanding of the process at hand is required to trade-off different constraints."
116,An OPC UA PubSub Implementation Approach for Memory-Constrained Sensor Devices,"Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA) comprises 14 specifications to deploy an industrial system with reliability, security, and interoperability. While realizing this standard, the devices of the considering industrial system must have enough capabilities in computation and storage. It is a challenge in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), a scenario in which field-level devices can be memory-constrained sensor devices. Tailoring OPC UA to fit such devices requires advanced programming skills; otherwise, system developers must simplify or remove some essential features of OPC UA. This paper presents another implementation approach to tailor OPC UA PubSub, a specification for the publish-subscribe messaging pattern, into memory-constrained sensor devices. This approach, titled OPC UA PubSub-C, proposes using a remote OPC UA server as a configurator to operate large-memory-footprint tasks for field-level devices."
126,Research and Implementation of Publish/Subscribe Communication Model Based on OPC UA,"In recent years, intelligent manufacturing has developed rapidly. Industrial IoT technologies are applied to different industrial scenarios. OPC UA is a service-oriented architecture, which has good interoperability. At the same time, it is a cross-platform communication standard that can realize the interconnection between heterogeneous network devices and solve the problem of information silos in the industrial IoT field. However, with the gradual increase of industrial equipment, the amount of data transmission in the network is increasing. The traditional OPC UA communication method based on client/server mode has defects such as tight coupling and performance bottleneck. It cannot meet the high throughput demand of the network. Therefore, these phenomena lead to longer time delays and lower transmission efficiency of network communication systems. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a publish/subscribe communication model based on OPC UA. We design the overall architecture of the OPC UA publish/subscribe model and adopt a message agent mechanism to realize distributed communication of OPC UA. This model has functions such as message modeling, address space construction, and publish/subscribe. The architecture of this communication model is compatible with the C/S model, which can ensure compatibility and coexistence with the traditional OPC UA communication system. Meanwhile, in order to improve the distinguished service capability of the OPC UA system, a multi-priority data scheduling algorithm is proposed and integrated into the publish/subscribe communication model to improve the efficiency of real-time data transmission in industrial networks. The experimental results show that the communication model can accomplish distributed communication in industrial networks and be better applied in wireless sensor networks. The scheduling algorithm included in the model significantly improves the efficiency of real-time data transmission and reduces the time delay."
135,Real-Time Communication Model Based on OPC UA Wireless Network for Intelligent Production Line,"With the continuous development of intelligent manufacturing technology, the intelligent production line for the Industrial Internet of Things occupies an important position in the field of industrial intelligence. OPC UA is a standard for communication data exchange between intelligent production line devices. OPC UA can establish a unified information model for production line devices and improve the connectivity of heterogeneous networks. However, in industrial wireless network application scenarios, there are various types of sensing information and large amounts of data to be transmitted. Each type of data has different requirements for real-time. The traditional OPC UA communication method is difficult to achieve real-time and reliable transmission in intelligent production lines and canâ€™t meet the transmission requirements of time-sensitive data. In this paper, we propose a real-time communication model of the OPC UA wireless network for intelligent production lines (UAMPDS). IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH is used as the wireless communication infrastructure, and OPC UA protocols are fused to this model. Meanwhile, we design a load-aware time-slot scheduling algorithm to dynamically allocate and schedule time slots according to the network topology and traffic load of each node. We also implement a dynamic preemptive resource scheduling strategy based on service differentiation to ensure real-time transmission of time-sensitive data. The experimental results show that this model achieves differentiated services based on data with different latency tolerance and effectively reduces the transmission latency of real-time service data under the constrained network resources. It can avoid the starvation phenomenon of low priority queues, and improves the overall quality of service of intelligent production line communication networks."
158,Assessment of Different OPC UA Implementations for Industrial IoT-Based Measurement Applications,"The industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) paradigm represents an attractive opportunity for new generation measurement applications, which are increasingly based on efficient and reliable communication systems to allow the extensive availability of continuous data from instruments and/or sensors, thus enabling real-time measurement analysis. Nevertheless, different communication systems and heterogeneous sensors and acquisition systems may be found in an IIoT-enabled measurement application, so that solutions need to be defined to tackle the issue of seamless, effective, and low-latency interoperability. A significant and appropriate solution is the open platform communications (OPCs) unified architecture (UA) protocol, thanks to its object-oriented structure that allows a complete contextualization of the information. The intrinsic complexity of OPC UA, however, imposes meaningful performance assessment to evaluate its suitability in the aforementioned context. To this aim, this article presents the design of a general yet accurate and reproducible measurement setup that will be exploited to assess the performance of the main open-source implementations of OPC UA. The final goal of this work is to provide a characterization of the impact of this protocol stack in an IIoT-enabled measurement system, in particular, in terms of both the latency introduced in the measurement process and the power consumption."
172,A Novel Smart Production Line Data Perception System Based on OPC UA,"With the rapid development of information and communication technology (ICT), traditional manufacturing is undergoing an upgrade and transformation to smart manufacturing. In order to achieve intelligent management and control of production process, data perception (DP) is the primary problem to be investigated during the transformation of current production line (PL). However, due to the numerous equipment types, heterogeneous communication protocols and interfaces, the cyber system and the physical world are severely separated, resulting in the phenomenon of information islands. In this paper, we propose a novel DP system architecture for smart production line (SPL) based on OPC UA, which is compatible with multiple device system protocols as well as provides a unified interaction interface for data-driven applications. Data collection and result feedback based on the protocol mapping and conversion are realized by flexibly utilizing two communication patterns of OPC UA, namely client-server (CS) and publish-subscribe (PubSub). The local and cloud case studies strongly verify the feasibility and prospect of the DP system."
176,Implementing an OPC UA interface for legacy PLC-based automation systems using the Azure cloud: An ICPS-architecture with a retrofitted RFID system,"Companies often have legacy systems within production processes. Many of these systems use proprietary information-communication-control-technologies (ICCT), among others, and for that reason it is difficult to integrate them into new industrial environments that require Industrie 4.0-compliances. The migration process of such industrial systems, i.e., retrofitting it into an Industrie 4.0-compliant, ICPS-Infrastructure, leads to the necessity of new features and components in the legacy architecture. This paper summarizes the process for retrofitting a flexible manufacturing system located at the Institute for Industrial Informatics, Automation and Robotics (I2AR) of the University of Applied Sciences Emden/Leer, integrating legacy PLCs, RFID and commercial cloud technology on the basis of an Industry 4.0-compliant digitalization of components with OPC UA interfaces. With the use of common technologies recommended for migrating legacy industrial systems into Industrie 4.0-compliant systems, the authors describe the major specifications and characteristics of a migration approach and resulted novel ICPS-architecture that allows the operator and/or other legacy automation and management systems to monitor and control the PLC component via a RAMI4.0-compliant digital interface, via a retrofitted RFID System."
195,5G Remote I/O System Design and Implement in Industry,"5G has gone to everyone with the characteristic of Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (uRLLC) and Enhance Mobile Broadband (eMBB), which can meet increasing industrial data transmission requirements. In this paper, a wireless I/O (Input or Output) System is designed to transmit I/O signal with OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) protocol in 5G Local Area Network (LAN). The system includes remote modules, which connect to sensors and actuators for data acquisition and output, a cloud server, which is used for Dynamic Domain Name Resolution (DDNS), and controllers that process the data and monitor remotely. Besides, the implemented system includes Raspberry Pi 4th, which is used as the remote module, and a DDNS server, which runs in the cloud. Finally, two scenarios are presented to transmit the sensors data with this system."
214,The application of open access middleware for cooperation among heterogeneous manufacturing systems,"The vision behind industry 4.0 is to create even smarter manufacturing facilities. Industry 4.0 includes both hardware and software components, which are expected to seamlessly interact in a secure manner. Thus, machinery and software components from different manufacturers should be able to communicate in a common language. Such a challenge is typically met by introducing a â€œmiddlewareâ€ to serve as a joint communication platform. In this paper we discuss the use of OPC UA standard for communication between hardware and software components in a typical manufacturing system. Further we develop a digital twin and present an demonstration of our digital laboratory."
215,An Approach of Load Balancers for Low-cost CPPSs in Software-defined Networking Architecture,"Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS) and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) will improve the flexibility of the future production systems in the newest smart factories. In advanced manufacturing industries, a large number of machines, goods, control systems, and information systems will be interconnected. For this reason, it is necessary to implement load balancing technologies that improve responsiveness and increase the availability of applications, particularly when low-cost devices are used. This paper presents a novel architecture approach for load balancing using Software-Defined Networking (SDN). The proposal is based on IEC-61499 standard over OPC UA in industrial communications, and it is aimed at optimizing resources, maximizing throughput, minimizing response time, and avoiding overload in low-cost devices."
217,Towards a Real-Time Capable Plug & Produce Environment for Adaptable Factories,"Industrial manufacturing is currently undergoing a transformation from mass production with inflexible production systems to individual production with adaptable cells. In order to ensure this adaptability of these systems, technologies such as plug & produce are needed, to integrate, modify and remove devices at runtime. Therefor an exact description of the system, the products and the capabilities / skills of the devices is essential as well as a network for communication between the devices. Deterministic data transmission is particularly important for distributed control systems. We propose an architecture for plug & produce mechanisms with hard real-time capable communication paths between the cyber-physical components using OPC UA PubSub over TSN and the ability to load and execute real-time critical tasks at runtime."
234,A Low-latency and Interoperable Industrial Internet of Things Architecture for Manufacturing Systems,"Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) as an emerging and prospective paradigm, has great potential to significantly improve production efficiency of manufacturing systems. An open data exchange standard, namely OPCUA, has been proposed for the IIoT systems to provide semantic interoperability over heterogeneous devices. However, a mass of traditional devices that do not support OPC UA, are still operating in legacy automation systems. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a three-layer IIoT architecture for manufacturing system, which combines OPC UA-based gateways and Time-Sensitive Software-Defined Networking (TSSDN) switches to realize the efficient and reliable communication. The OPC UA is adopted to realize the interoperability of heterogeneous devices and the TSSDN achieves centralized control of network resources and flexible configuration in real-time industrial networks. Finally, we design a smart factory test bed, to evaluate the applicability of the proposed system architecture, in which we implement the information model and data transmission based on OPC UA."
235,Development of a Power Supply Control System and Virtual Simulation Based on Docker,"A proton therapy facility (HUST-PTF) based on a superconducting cyclotron is being developed by Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) and China Academy of Atomic Energy (CIAE). The beam transport system in this facility provides the required beam for the treatment rooms. The beamline control system (BCS) manages the operation of the degrader, beamline magnet power supplies (PS), diagnostics devices, etc. For additional security, BCS utilizes the OPC UA as the distributed control protocol. Since the PS controllers adopt a TCP communication protocol, an OPC UA server with TCP driver is developed as a gateway and front controller for PS control. In order to adapt fast beam-energy change, the ""list-trigger"" strategy is applied to the PS control. BCS downloads the respective current value lists to PS controllers before the treatment, and then triggers the PS controllers by pulse signals to alter the operation current to the next value in the list during the treatment. It is vital to decide when the current regulation process is complete in the transitional period, BCS should update the current values more frequent than the steady state. Therefore, the OPC UA server adopts the node dynamic refresh scheme. A virtual simulation based on docker followed by a thorough analysis are conducted on the PS control system, where the results show the node refresh time of the OPC UA server meets the PS control requirement. The virtual simulation is also proved to be cost-saving and reliable for control system tests and worth promoting."
246,Digitizing a Distributed Textile Production Process using Industrial Internet of Things: A Use-Case,"Many textile production chains are highly fragmented and distributed over several locations and countries. Textile machinery usually relies on proprietary software and hardware that cannot be sufficiently interlinked. As a result, machine and product data is not comprehensively collected and analyzed across the whole production process. Thus, the potential of Smart Manufacturing and Industry 4.0 is often not fully exploited in the textile industry. In recent years, vendor-independent machine to machine communication protocols and standards, such as OPC UA and MQTT have been suggested for the digitization of production facilities by integrating or replacing these proprietary systems. In contrast, there is still a lack of publicly available working demonstrations and exemplary implementations in the textile context. In this paper, we use Industrial Internet of Things technologies to design an open digital infrastructure for textile manufacturing. We develop our approach based on a production use-case that is distributed across multiple locations. By machine networking and integrating information flows from the shop floor to the cloud, we lay the basis for getting most value out of process-wide collected data. Our suggested infrastructure supports the use of Machine Learning techniques to enable various Smart Manufacturing applications, such as Predictive Maintenance and Predictive Quality."
256,On Developing a Collaborative and Interoperable Mobile Production Platform for an Agile Factory: A Case Study,"This paper reports on the development of a ""mobile production platform"" (MPP), which comprises a mobile robot with lifting capability and an ABB IRB14000 YuMI precision robot mounted on top of it. The MPP is capable of moving to different locations in the production space to perform production. Different programming languages and specification standards are used such as the graphical IEC 61499 language, Robot Operating System (ROS), and ABB's Rapid language. To allow easy communication with other actors programmed in different languages on the factory floor, the MPP utilizes the well-known OPC UA, the communication standard defined by the Reference Architectural Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0)."
