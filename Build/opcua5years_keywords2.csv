Standalone OPC UA Wrapper for Industrial Monitoring and Control Systems,W. Kim; M. Sung,"Department of Mechanical and Information Engineering, The University of Seoul, Seoul, South Korea; Department of Mechanical and Information Engineering, The University of Seoul, Seoul, South Korea",IEEE Access,23 Jul 2018,2018,6,,36557,36570,"OPC unified architecture (UA), a communication standard for the manufacturing industry, enables exchanging control and management data among distributed entities in industrial automation systems. OPC UA wrapper is a migration strategy that provides UA clients with seamless access to legacy servers having OPC classic interfaces. This paper presents the design of a standalone OPC UA wrapper and discusses its performance through extensive experiments using a prototype implementation. The wrapper consists of two main components, i.e., UA server and classic client, which communicate with each other via shared memory and semaphore. One important feature of the design is that it employs a distributed component object model runtime library implemented in Java for platform independence. This makes it possible to build a cost-competitive wrapper system by using commercial off-the-shelf non-Windows solutions with low-cost microprocessors. Another key feature is the event-driven update interface between the UA and classic components, which we propose as an alternative to the sampling-based mechanism for the reduced delay. Through experiments using workloads from an industrial monitoring system, we present a systematic approach of identifying the system parameters having a direct impact on the wrapper performance and eventually tuning them such that the read and subscription services of OPC UA exhibit the best performance.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2852792,University of Seoul; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8403102,OPC unified architecture;OPC UA wrapper;monitoring and control systems;read and subscription service,Servers;Monitoring;Standards;Control systems;Delays;Automation;Prototypes,client-server systems;factory automation;Internet;Java;process monitoring;software architecture;user interfaces,control systems;standalone OPC UA wrapper;wrapper performance;system parameters;industrial monitoring system;classic components;event-driven update interface;cost-competitive wrapper system;distributed component object model runtime library;semaphore;shared memory;classic client;prototype implementation;OPC classic interfaces;legacy servers;seamless access;migration strategy;industrial automation systems;distributed entities;management data;manufacturing industry;communication standard;OPC unified architecture,,20,,48,OAPA,4 Jul 2018,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,,,

The industry is constantly researching and developing solutions for vertical and horizontal interoperation of systems, some concepts being already well-grounded. One of the main issues is the interfacing. The industry accepted the OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) protocol as of high importance for interoperability in the IIoT context. The automotive industry is considered to have a separate path, because of a somehow more rigid approach towards communication and data integration. But, car-to-infrastructure and even car-to-car communication are requiring data exchange and implicitly a newer approach from the automotive industry. Recently, VSOMEIP (Scalable service Oriented MiddlewarE over IP from Genivi) interfacing is more and more present in automotive, its main focus being to assure interoperation between the Electronic Control Units (ECUs). The current paper proposes a VSOMEIP - OPC UA gateway conceptual solution that assures car interfacing in the IIoT context. The proof of concept is implemented regarding AUTOSAR (Automotive Open System Architecture) requirements, using a tailored operating system on an embedded device.

In the case that the number of terminal accesses is increasing and the traffic volume is gradually increasing, some server nodes of the system are overloaded or crash. In response to these questions, this paper presents a dynamic control model based on state perception. This model can perceive the communication state of client and server in real time, and uses the current resource occupancy index of the server and the network congestion indicators of each client as the adjustment conditions. The model algorithm can dynamically adjust the client served by the overload node to the server node with small load.

Introduction of Group-Subscriptions for RESTful OPC UA clients in IIoT environments,R. Schiekofer; M.

According to a study of McKinsey the potential economic impact of the IoT within factories may reach up to 3,7 Trillion Dollar by 2025. To unlock this potential it is very important to bridge the interoperability gap. Since V1.04 OPC UA also supports session-less clients and therefore allows the development of RESTful clients which can be used to address the cross-domain interoperability issue. However, currently, RESTful clients cannot use Subscriptions, because the corresponding Service Sets are not supported for session-less clients. In this paper, we will present how Subscriptions can be introduced for session-less clients. Furthermore, we outline how Group-Subscriptions can be introduced for session-less as well as session-based clients.

When the system specification and design evolve, system developers need to update the information model from the system design. It is tricky for testbeds that frequently are updated with new devices, protocols, and development tools demanded by different use cases. This paper shares our long-term OPC UA-based robotic testbed for Industry 4.0 research and the strategy to develop it.

However, the engineering effort for OPC UA applications, in particular the server, is very high as the process of information modeling and linking the resulting model to real-world data is complex and time-consuming. This significantly limits the spread of OPC UA in manufacturing and other domains.This paper presents an approach towards extending OPC UA in a way such that information necessary for the OPC UA server application to access the underlying system can be specified in the information model. This is achieved by defining communication interfaces for all nodes of the information model that represent readable or writable data. The handling of the interfaces needs to be implemented in code only once and from then on they can be modeled, rather than implemented for each node individually. Thus, the implementation effort of OPC UA servers is reduced. Different modeling approaches for communication interfaces are presented and compared.",1946-0759,978-1-7281-0303-7,10.1109/ETFA.2019.8869383,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8869383,OPC UA;communication interface;web service,Unified modeling language;Servers;Data models;Web services;Robots;XML,production engineering computing;Web services,communication interface specification;Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture;information modeling;OPC UA server application;communication interfaces;Industry 4.0,,2,,10,IEEE,17 Oct 2019,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,

This paper aims to build a compliance testing methodology for external vendors of an organisation who are interconnected with the OPC UA Server-Client Protocols. The structure is built on a host of UA clients that test UA specifications and information models from these vendors. This enables an organisational entity, for example, a manufacturer, to provide its clients, in this case external vendors such as suppliers, with the flexibility of conforming to prescribed standards in a testing phase on an automated digital platform rather than with older methods such as data transfer though databases or documents. An implementation of this approach is presented using example servers created for this purpose.

Most industrial applications use vendor-specific data access and extract metadata either hard-coded or not, mainly because the used communication protocols are fast but have limited expressiveness. More powerful and convenient query languages (QLs) exist but are not yet applied to these scenarios. This paper crosses that bridge by transforming queries formulated in highly expressive QLs into lower-expressive ones to enable flexible metadata access in existing setups. We apply our methodology to an POC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) application in manufacturing and implement an open-source mapping from the expressive QL XPath. We export OPC UA information models to XML, design XPath expressions, transform these to OPC UA, and finally execute them in OPC UA with a patched client. An evaluation in a real-world injection molding application demonstrates how we, in addition to raw sensor values, dynamically capture associated metadata such as unit, scale, and precision.

To overcome these drawbacks, we have developed and implemented a cost-efficient and continuous signal monitoring of Ethernet-based industrial bus systems. Several methods have been developed to assess the quality of the cable. These methods can be classified to either passive or active.

However, the ongoing development towards the Industry 4.0 involves new models and concepts and hence more and more automated control functions will become necessary. That is, devices such as cranes in the material handling domain will become smarter and will also be networked to a larger extent. However, it will be required that control messages passed to the cranes through a network, possibly shared with other traffic, are guaranteed to arrive in time. In this paper, we present an OPC UA-based model of an overhead travelling crane as part of a material handling scenario. The crane can be controlled by a crane remote controller, which we model as well.

Built-in security mechanisms enable these protocols to protect communication and defend against network attacks. However, before IIoT devices can utilize these security mechanisms, they need to be securely onboarded in the network. Although several onboarding solutions exist, there is no widely applicable and easy solution for all protocols. Thus, owners of IIoT devices must currently perform multiple processes until they can securely use a device in operation, which requires a high amount of manual effort and onboarding infrastructure.In this work, we present a generic secure onboarding solution for a broad range of network protocols based on OPC UA. OPC UA is particularly suited for this task, as it is one of the most widespread IIoT protocols and one of few protocols whose standard defines a secure onboarding. Our solution leverages the OPC UA onboarding process to equip other IIoT protocols with the initial trust and credentials to establish secure connections. To this end, only minor extensions to the OPC UA implementation on devices are necessary, such that device owners can reuse their OPC UA onboarding infrastructure without any modifications. As a proof of concept for our solution, we demonstrate the secure onboarding of an HTTPS web server.

OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) provides an extensible information model but lacks formal semantics. Ontologies based on the Web Ontology Language (OWL) can provide such formal semantics. Thus, we present a transformation approach that converts OPC UA information models (or only parts of them) into domain-specific ontologies. The transformation process consists of two steps. The first step is a mapping from OPC UA to OWL Full. The second step performs a graph transformation, based on SPARQL rules, into the domain-specified target ontology. The adaption of this transformation to the source information model and the target ontology can be accomplished by only adapting these transformation rules.

In distributed control systems, the functionality of an automation component can be offered to the other parties that constitute a production system via a standardized interface, easing the orchestration of the whole system. This paper proposes such a generic interface that hides away the low-level implementation details of a particular functionality and provides a common semantic model for the execution.

The Internet enables the development of distributed systems consisting of loosely coupled and interacting components such as robots, plants and control software. The components are not permanently tied to each other, but rather dynamically combined according to the specific requirements of the target system. This results in highly flexible systems that are distributed globally and across company boundaries. The development, maintenance and modification of various components is decentralized and can therefore lead to incompatibilities that can impair their interoperability. This paper describes an approach for the interaction of control software, which ensures interoperability of components in distributed systems.

To improve management efficiency, it is necessary to construct a unified information model and an adaptive communication framework for manufacturing lines with heterogeneous (high reliable/ low load) needs. OPC UA has become a prominent solution for remote configuration with extensible information models and various transport mechanisms. However, the existing solutions based on OPC UA focus on the information model and communication framework for the machine level, which is hard to support efficient remote management of the production line.

Beginning from OPC UA v1.04, which was released in 2021, Pub/Sub mode has been supported in addition to Client/Server. Because it can easily support much more communications than usual, it can support all use cases in the industrial sector. An important property of OPC UA is encryption. It is effective in protecting communication data from tampering and eavesdropping but also makes it impossible to monitor communications. In ICS, ill commands to controllers can cause dangerous situations. Even a secure communication protocol cannot guarantee that the data being communicated are safe. There are many types of machines, such as operating support systems and engineering workstations, that can send commands to controllers.

It refers to an organized structure representing resources in the form of opc UA nodes residing in an opc UA address space. Before runtime, an opc UA server requires an opc UA information model already filled with opc UA nodes corresponding to the available resources of its field devices. It is tricky to the Industrial Internet of Things, a scenario where random field devices can join a sys-tem at any time.

The recently proposed control architectures target, among other plug-and-produce features, a reduction of configuration times. This is relevant for building a new production line as well as for faster reconfiguration when adding new hardware and product variants to an existing manufacturing line. This paper identifies operational requirements for such reconfiguration scenarios and proposes a way to implement them using the concept of a device adapter. The device adapter contains a device description and constantly updates it following the reconfiguration changes happening in a manufacturing system. This allows not only to detect the changes in the hardware, which appear in the production system, using the device discovery mechanisms but also automatically adapt the software. Preliminary tests have been performed on a demonstrator that shows both virtual and physical executions combined in a single system. The proposed solution supports automatic hardware and software reconfiguration on-the-fly without a need to stop and restart the whole production system.",1946-0759,978-1-7281-0303-7,10.1109/ETFA.2019.8869208,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8869208,Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems;Skill-Based Engineering;AutomationML;OPC UA,Workstations;Automation;Manufacturing systems;Software,agile manufacturing;flexible manufacturing systems;mass production;product customisation;production engineering computing;reconfigurable architectures;software architecture,agile operational behavior;control-level devices;ongoing manufacturing systems transformation;mass production;mass customization;flexible engineering solutions;plug-produce production environments;new production line;automatic hardware reconfiguration;automatic software reconfiguration;automationML,,12,,23,IEEE,17 Oct 2019,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,

OPC UA is a standard that enables interoperable, secure, and reliable communication between industrial devices. To defend against cyber attacks, OPC UA has built-in security mechanisms that protect the authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of data in transit. Before communicating securely, it is essential that OPC UA devices are set up in a secure manner. This process is referred to as secure provisioning. An improper provisioning can lead to weak or insecure OPC UA deployments that enable adversaries to eavesdrop or even manipulate communication between industrial devices. Such insecure deployments can also be maliciously provoked by adversaries who tamper with insecure provisioning solutions. Despite secure provisioning is essential for OPC UA security and usability, there exists no overview and systematic analysis on the patchwork of different solutions in industry and academia. This article presents the first investigation of secure device provisioning solutions for the OPC UA communication protocol. First, desired objectives and evaluation criteria for secure provisioning of OPC UA devices are defined. Next, existing and emerging OPC UA provisioning solutions are analyzed and compared based on the elaborated objectives and criteria. Additionally, an outlook into the future of OPC UA provisioning is given, based on solutions from the IoT domain. Finally, the analyzed OPC UA secure provisioning solutions are compared, recommendations are given, and research gaps are identified.

The achievement of that goal is bound to the adoption of enabling information technologies (IoT, Cloud, Big Data) to build a unified and integrated view of the information generated at all stages of the industrial processes, both operational and business oriented ones. This paper focuses on the need for manufacturing companies of tools that concretely implement this data integration as a requirement to enforce the improvements fostered and needed by the I4.0 revolution. This paper follows a former work that proposed the design and implementation of a platform realizing the integration of the operational and the business views at the data level.

To enable interoperability and smooth integration of the devices into the I4.0 middleware, an application implementing the device's functionality should be able to interact with different AASs. In this work, we investigate the integration of the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) runtime systems into the I4.0 middleware. For doing this, we specify the function blocks (FBs) for connecting the PLCs with AASs and other I4.0 components, such as registry and discovery server. We analyze the requirements of such FBs while focusing on REST/HTTP- and OPC UA-based AASs, and provide interface specification for IEC 61499- and IEC 61131-3-based FBs. Furthermore, we implemented an FB library that enables communication with an AAS from the respective control applications.

The proposed approach is based on a data mapping from the simulation's meta data model to the OPC UA information model and a concurrent architecture based on message passing between the OPC UA server and the simulation software. The data mapping utilizes the simulation's and OPC UA's reflection mechanisms to automatically generate OPC UA address spaces from simulation models. The inverse mapping is used to automatically generate simulation model structure from queries to an existing OPC UA server. The concurrent architecture enables large numbers of simulated objects to be equipped with individual and independent OPC UA servers and clients. This allows the simulation of entire scenarios with simulated objects communicating with each other and with external software. The usefulness extends to distributed simulation use cases, where models populate individual instances of the simulation software and communicate over a real network. The implementation is applied to simulate an automotive production line, where multiple machines are equipped with individual OPC UA servers and communicate with 3rd party software.

Therefore, it is mandatory that system architects systematically explore and evaluate all architectural alternatives of the highly constrained design space defined by the systems functional and economical objectives.

In addition, the OPC-UA enables the semantic modelling of the electric vehicle integrating all the interrelationships among the various subsystems and their components.

One of the most significant and wide-spread protocols for Ethernet-based data exchange between industrial devices and controls is the Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA). Although the OPC UA standard includes certificate-based security measures, it lacks of applicable solutions for bootstrapping trust. For secure communication, each OPC UA application is supposed to hold an application certificate which can be managed by a Global Discovery Server (GDS). Simply put, applications request their certificate from the GDS as well as information about trustworthy and revoked certificates of third parties. However, the OPC UA specifications do not suggest a secure method to establish the initial trust for the communication between an application and the GDS.

CIM focuses on the organizational structures of different components within the smart grid while IEC 61850 focuses on the structure of information exchanges between field devices and systems. CIM can possibly be used for power system domain ontology and indeed for physical modeling too. On the other hand, the IEC 61850-7-420 defines object classes for assets such as Distributed Energy Resource (DER) which may include solar generation, storage, diesel generators etc., DER unit controllers, and other DER-associated power electronic devices (e.g., inverter). These object classes describe asset-specific attributes such as type of assets, set points, state of charge, limits, and ramp rate etc. While acknowledging the cumbersomeness involved in IEC 61850 engineering, there is a need to develop an easily engineer-able and interoperable system that would achieve the efficient operation of microgrid control system.

Based on the enormous amount of data stored in the Cloud, new analysis algorithms can be run and the extracted information can be sold as “service”. Even if today the Industry 4.0 applications have still a slow reaction time, it is clear that “short latency services” may have competitive advantage in the market. For this reason, this paper is focused on the evaluation of the communication delay due to the transfer of data from the source (i.e. the production line) to the Cloud and the way back. The reference architecture considered in this paper is based on: the well accepted OPC UA (Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture) access method for retrieving data directly from the device inside the production line; and a classic gateway approach for sending data in real (commercial) Cloud platforms. In this paper a test methodology is proposed and a use case is presented to show its feasibility. The experimental outcomes demonstrate that, by means of the proposed methodology, flexible solutions based on OPC UA combined with industrial grade IoT gateways can be easily evaluated. From the perspective of the considered use case, the average delay due to communication from the production line (in details: from a Siemens S7 1500 controller) to the Cloud (IBM Bluemix platform) is less than 300 ms with a standard deviation of about 70 ms over two weeks observation time.",,978-1-5386-2497-5,10.1109/METROI4.2018.8428346,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8428346,Industry 4.0;Distributed measurement systems;Automation Networks;Node-RED;Cloud computing;OPC UA,Cloud computing;Delays;Industries;Logic gates;Protocols;Servers;Automation,cloud computing;delays;Internet;Internet of Things;internetworking;manufacturing industries;manufacturing systems;production engineering computing;programmable controllers,communication delay;OPCUA;data sharing;short latency services;production line;IBM Bluemix platform;cloud computing;industrial internet of things;industry 4.0 applications;open platform communications unified architecture;gateway approach;distributed measurement systems;Siemens S7 1500 controller,,2,,22,IEEE,9 Aug 2018,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,

One way to achieve this, lies in the use of OPC UA and the asset administration shell. Together they can implement an Industrie 4.0 Component as the standardized service for tailored data integration and usage. Data in OPC UA is available in different levels of abstraction, both in terms of the data and its description. Rarely is the asset administration shell (AAS) considered in this context. This paper will introduce a first approach to harmonize OPC UA and the AAS in an I4.0 compliant Aggregation Server. The server is able to aggregate information models based on the current meta model mapping of the AAS, regardless of whether the base servers implement this or not.

However, the recent increase in connectivity has led to an extended attack vector. Therefore, it is important that CPS are secured against current and — due to their long life span — also against future threats, such as quantum computers. The security of present communication can be broken once a sufficiently powerful quantum computer is available. To protect against this attack vector, applications and protocols should start utilizing quantum-resistant primitives. One approach that maintains common security guarantees and protects against quantum computer attacks is to use hybrid constructions: a combination of classically secure and quantum-resistant schemes. In this work, we propose a hybrid key exchange mechanism for the industrial communication protocol Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA). We describe four distinct instantiations based on selected quantum-resistant key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs), namely NewHope, NTRU, CRYSTALS-Kyber, and Saber.

Contemporary CPPSs require frequent changes in communication paths and the signals communicated (i.e., rewiring) to flexibly adapt to changing production needs and environmental conditions. The integration of shopfloor participants and their wiring, hence, becomes a critical aspect of a dynamically adaptable production system.

These modelling technologies already reduce integration efforts as they provide a common Application Programming Interface (API) to handle and access properties and methods that are exposed by applications running on the CPS. These properties and methods can be structured and enriched with semantics within an information model. The integration of the information model with the application is still a quite complex task that typically requires comparable large manual programming efforts and additional components to manage the interaction between application and model. This work targets especially at more complex applications that shall be configurable through the information model - therefore a use case of a configurable state-machine is discussed in this work. To manage the interaction between such a dynamic application and an information model, a tight coupling of both is required. This work targets at re-use and integration of application code with information modelling based on annotations added to the application code. As a result, the object-structure and the (business) logic of the objects is integrated with the model.

Thus, the potential of Smart Manufacturing and Industry 4.0 is often not fully exploited in the textile industry. In recent years, vendor-independent machine to machine communication protocols and standards, such as OPC UA and MQTT have been suggested for the digitization of production facilities by integrating or replacing these proprietary systems. In contrast, there is still a lack of publicly available working demonstrations and exemplary implementations in the textile context.

Industrial IoT technologies are applied to different industrial scenarios. OPC UA is a service-oriented architecture, which has good interoperability. At the same time, it is a cross-platform communication standard that can realize the interconnection between heterogeneous network devices and solve the problem of information silos in the industrial IoT field. However, with the gradual increase of industrial equipment, the amount of data transmission in the network is increasing. The traditional OPC UA communication method based on client/server mode has defects such as tight coupling and performance bottleneck. It cannot meet the high throughput demand of the network. Therefore, these phenomena lead to longer time delays and lower transmission efficiency of network communication systems. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a publish/subscribe communication model based on OPC UA. We design the overall architecture of the OPC UA publish/subscribe model and adopt a message agent mechanism to realize distributed communication of OPC UA. This model has functions such as message modeling, address space construction, and publish/subscribe. The architecture of this communication model is compatible with the C/S model, which can ensure compatibility and coexistence with the traditional OPC UA communication system. Meanwhile, in order to improve the distinguished service capability of the OPC UA system, a multi-priority data scheduling algorithm is proposed and integrated into the publish/subscribe communication model to improve the efficiency of real-time data transmission in industrial networks. The experimental results show that the communication model can accomplish distributed communication in industrial networks and be better applied in wireless sensor networks.

Among various intelligent manufacturing features, product traceability and customized service are highly desired, which not only enables the tracking of the end to end inventory to ensure high reliability, but also provides personalized characteristics to meet different customer demands. However, in tradition, such traceability or customized service are achieved at the cost additional time-consuming steps and hence incur more manufacturing cost. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a low latency OPC-UA based IIoT system and apply that to the production line for product traceability and customized service.

The integration of information and communication technologies (ICT) and the advantages of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) will result in automation processes aiming to optimize efficiency or reduce expenses. However, this results in the emergence of on-demand manufacturing as well as the provision of personalized goods and services, produced in the context of shortened innovation cycles. However, the downside of this trend is the uprising complexity that appears when engineering such systems.

Thus, this paper introduces an approach proposing Round-trip Engineering (RTE) of previously modeled industrial system components. In order to do so, first the information and communication architecture is modeled according to the specifications of RAMI 4.0 and by utilizing OPC UA. Subsequently, the modeled components are generated and applied with the help of FREDOSAR, an open-source system architecture aimed for the application in such a complex system.

Under the condition of diversified sensor information and large amount of data need to be transmitted, traditional communication methods cannot realize real-time and reliable transmission of time-sensitive data. In view of the low real-time transmission of time-sensitive data in the current intelligent production line transmission network and the inability to adopt a reasonable scheduling method for data with different delay tolerances, this paper proposes a multi-priority real-time data transmission scheduling method (MPRTDT). This method is based on the OPC unified architecture (OPC UA) heterogeneous network equipment interconnection model, and divides the alarm data, status data, image data and video data in this model queue into 4 different priorities, and uses a mixed time slot data transmission mechanism to combine multiple time slots into a perceptual time slot (PTS). According to the different priorities of industrial data, this algorithm achieves a reasonable allocation of perceptual time slots. This model combines the queue dynamic transmission scheduling mechanism to ensure the priority transmission of high-priority real-time data such as alarm information.

OPC UA is widely recognized as one of the effective technologies to address such an issue. Traditional ways of constructing OPC UA information model need to manually add and define different nodes describing the devices and their attributes (e.g., names, ID, data types, etc.), which is costly and time-consuming when a huge number of devices is involved. Some works defined mapping rules between existing data model/structure/exchange format and OPC UA information model to reduce the workloads. However, they ignored the construction process of OPC UA information model and assumed that the existing referenced data structure/exchange format was created before the transformation of information model. Also, the mapping rules do not provide detailed implementation of mapping method. In this paper, we take the first attempt on the fast construction process of OPC UA information model. The raw data of field devices represented as structured data in rational database is fully utilized to extract the information, even though there are no existing data model for reference.

In applications in which several automation systems are used, such as in aeronautics or automotive manufacturing cells, several PLC's and drives are used to control the motion of the different electromechanical components. In order to verify and validate (V&V) automation code before deployment in the production environment, virtual commissioning (VC) techniques have become of great interest in the last decades. Even if VC simulation approaches, based on software/hardware-in-the-loop (SiL, HiL), have shown effectiveness to V&V automation code, the continuity from the execution to the simulation layers may not be ensured due to a lack of interoperability in the toolchain. Additionally, the development of reliable component models is a complex task of the VC solution since it requires a high level of mechatronics expertise. In order to avoid losing information between the execution and the simulation layers of VC toolchains, this paper presents a SiL based approach for interconnecting the PLC's with the VC simulation tool by means of OPC-UA-based technologies.

The beam transport system in this facility provides the required beam for the treatment rooms. The beamline control system (BCS) manages the operation of the degrader, beamline magnet power supplies (PS), diagnostics devices, etc. For additional security, BCS utilizes the OPC UA as the distributed control protocol. Since the PS controllers adopt a TCP communication protocol, an OPC UA server with TCP driver is developed as a gateway and front controller for PS control. In order to adapt fast beam-energy change, the ""list-trigger"" strategy is applied to the PS control. BCS downloads the respective current value lists to PS controllers before the treatment, and then triggers the PS controllers by pulse signals to alter the operation current to the next value in the list during the treatment. It is vital to decide when the current regulation process is complete in the transitional period, BCS should update the current values more frequent than the steady state. Therefore, the OPC UA server adopts the node dynamic refresh scheme. A virtual simulation based on docker followed by a thorough analysis are conducted on the PS control system, where the results show the node refresh time of the OPC UA server meets the PS control requirement.

As an open platform, open-source OPC UAs such as open62541, OpenOPCUA, and FreeOpcUa is currently being developed by several developer communities. Implementing open-source OPC UA is an attractive option if cost is a significant consideration. However, the primary purpose of implementing OPC UA is to communicate or exchange information effectively and reliably; information about the characteristics and performance of open-source OPC is needed before designing a particular open-source OPC-based automation system platform. This paper utilized FreeOpcUa, a Python OPC UA library, to determine communication traffic features between client and server and perform anomaly detection on the traffic. The results showed that when all clients read server data simultaneously, there was duplication (up to 9%) and loss (up to 5%) of some data packets.

OPC UA is a standard for communication data exchange between intelligent production line devices. OPC UA can establish a unified information model for production line devices and improve the connectivity of heterogeneous networks. However, in industrial wireless network application scenarios, there are various types of sensing information and large amounts of data to be transmitted. Each type of data has different requirements for real-time. The traditional OPC UA communication method is difficult to achieve real-time and reliable transmission in intelligent production lines and can’t meet the transmission requirements of time-sensitive data. In this paper, we propose a real-time communication model of the OPC UA wireless network for intelligent production lines (UAMPDS). IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH is used as the wireless communication infrastructure, and OPC UA protocols are fused to this model. Meanwhile, we design a load-aware time-slot scheduling algorithm to dynamically allocate and schedule time slots according to the network topology and traffic load of each node. We also implement a dynamic preemptive resource scheduling strategy based on service differentiation to ensure real-time transmission of time-sensitive data. The experimental results show that this model achieves differentiated services based on data with different latency tolerance and effectively reduces the transmission latency of real-time service data under the constrained network resources.

Bakken,"Department of Computer Science, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway",2021 26th IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA ),30 Nov 2021,2021,,,1,7,"OPC UA is an open set of specifications for communication and modelling that have found extensive use in industrial automation. OPC UA information models are part of the specification and are used by asset owners and equipment vendors to describe the static parameters and time varying signals belonging to equipment in standardized ways. Such descriptions are aimed to drastically reduce the cost of integrating software managing these industrial assets. Hindering the adoption of OPC UA information models is their inherent complexity and the problematic specification of query support. Previous research has implemented the OPC UA query specification using SPARQL and found that formulating queries in SPARQL natively provides shorter queries that are easier to formulate. However, parts of the OPC UA graph are time-varying, and may index large time series data sets, which are sub-optimally handled by most available SPARQL databases. We show how OPC UA can be mapped to the Semantic Web in a way that allows a hybrid approach where time series data is stored in a specialized system and describe a query rewriting approach that allows for joint queries over static OPC UA information models and time series data. Compared to existing approaches, we argue that our approach is better suited for analytics applications that require portability across infrastructure and allows a greater range of SPARQL engines. A prototype implementation called Quarry is open sourced under the Apache 2.0 license to improve the accessibility and reproducibility of this research area.",,978-1-7281-2989-1,10.1109/ETFA45728.2021.9613487,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9613487,OPC Unified Architecture;Semantic Web;SPARQL;Query processing;Time series data,Semantic Web;Time series analysis;Prototypes;Computer architecture;Licenses;Tools;Data models,public domain software;query languages;query processing;semantic Web;SQL;time series,hybrid approach;query rewriting approach;joint queries;static OPC UA information models;SPARQL engines;Quarry;open sourced;open source tool;hybrid architectures;industrial automation;asset owners;equipment vendors;static parameters;industrial assets;problematic specification;query support;OPC UA query specification;formulating queries;shorter queries;OPC UA graph;time-varying;time series data sets;available SPARQL databases,,1,,24,IEEE,30 Nov 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,
OPC UA Nodestore Switch - Usage Scenarios,T. Miny; J. Grothoff; U. Epple,"Chair of Process Control, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany; Chair of Process Control, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany; Chair of Process Control, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany",2020 IEEE 18th International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN),7 Jun 2021,2020,1,,299,304,"OPC Unified Architecture is one of the leading technologies to realize the horizontal and vertical communication from enterprise layer down to the field layer in automation technology. It defines an address space model consisting of nodes and references without specifying how to store these. Therefore, this paper first describes the concept of a nodestore and a nodestore switch. The core contribution of the nodestore switch is the decoupling of OPC UA servers from their node storage. Based on this, four usage scenarios demonstrate how to utilize the concept to address different requirements, like performance and persistence, the integration of domain specific (proprietary) meta models, the adaptation at runtime and sharing of information models. For each usage scenario a prototypical implementation is described to show an exemplary realization and to gather a deeper understanding of the usage.",2378-363X,978-1-7281-4964-6,10.1109/INDIN45582.2020.9442186,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9442186,OPC Unified Architecture;Nodestore Switch;Usage Scenarios;Industry 4.0,Adaptation models;Runtime;Automation;Conferences;Switches;Servers;Informatics,application program interfaces;machine-to-machine communication;production engineering computing,Industry 4.0;fourth industrial revolution;horizontal communication;OPC UA nodestore switch;node storage;OPC UA servers;address space model;automation technology;vertical communication;OPC unified architecture;usage scenario,,,,12,IEEE,7 Jun 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,

One of many approaches of describing this category of systems is a mathematical formalism called the Petri Net. This article introduces an original software solution, leveraging the graphical representation of this formalism in conjunction with the communication standard OPC Unified Architecture. This combination enables the user to model and control discrete event and hybrid systems using an intuitive, user-friendly graphical interface. The software application also brings new possibilities into scope of this academic domain due to the implementation of a Petri Net formalism extension - continuous elements, which greatly expands the area of systems, which can be modelled and controlled using this tool. The developed software tool was successfully verified in control of a virtual systems. Offering a graphical environment for the design of discrete event / hybrid system control algorithms, it can be used for education, research and practice in cyber-physical systems (Industry 4.0).",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3222828,"Slovak Research and Development Agency(grant numbers:APVV-21-0125); Cultural and Educational Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic(grant numbers:KEGA 016STU-4/2020,039STU-4/2021); Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic(grant numbers:1/0107/22); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9953998,Discrete-event system;OPC unified architecture;cyber-physical system;system control;hybrid system;Petri nets,Petri nets;Protocols;Control systems;Computational modeling;Software;Object oriented modeling;Matlab;Discrete-event systems,cyber-physical systems;discrete event systems;graphical user interfaces;Petri nets,communication standard OPC Unified Architecture;control discrete event;control discrete event systems;cyber-physical systems;cyber-physical systems Industry 4.0;developed software tool;discrete event system;graphical environment;graphical representation;hybrid system control algorithms;hybrid systems;intuitive user friendly;mathematical formalism;original software solution;Petri Net formalism extension;Petri nets;software application;virtual systems,,,,49,CCBY,17 Nov 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,,,

However, heterogeneous and disjoint data is common in this domain. As a consequence, contextual information of an event might be incomplete or improperly interpreted which results in suboptimal analysis results. This paper proposes an approach to access a production systems' event data based on the event data's context (such as the product type, process type or process parameters). The approach extracts filtered event logs from a database system by combining: 1) a semantic model of a production system’s hierarchical structure, 2) a formalized process description and 3) an OPC UA information model. As a proof of concept we demonstrate our approach using a sample server based on OPC UA for Machinery Companion Specifications.",,978-1-6654-9996-5,10.1109/ETFA52439.2022.9921565,Ministry of Education; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9921565,Ontology;OPC Unified Architecture;Semantic Web;Cyber-Physical Production System;Formalized Process Description,Production systems;Terminology;Semantics;Time series analysis;Relational databases;Production facilities;Timing,control engineering computing;data mining;electronic data interchange;formal specification;process control;production engineering computing;software architecture,OPC UA information model;semantic process descriptions;event data;production systems;heterogeneous data;disjoint data;contextual information;suboptimal analysis results;product type;process type;database system;semantic model;production system;formalized process description,,,,24,IEEE,25 Oct 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,
